            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
            <p>THE Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi>'s Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe hath appeared three ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times, and at each time in a very different condition: The firſt in a Manuſcript about four years ago, at that time only containing the Articles of worſhipping Saints, of Images and Reliques, the matter of Juſtification, and that of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, excepting only the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, which was not as yet therein. The ſecond about nine or ten moneths paſt, of the firſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, which was recalled. The Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> had thereunto joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at that time, not onely the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Euchariſt, of Tradition, of the authority of the Church, of the authority of the Pope, all which do make the ampleſt and moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable part of his Treatiſe, but he had alſo changed ſeveral places of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:37449:7"/>
Manuſcript Copy. The third, as it doth now appear in this ſecond Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which the Printer calls the firſt, becauſe the firſt was not publiſhed; and it is in this ſecond Edition chiefly, that it is to be found that the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> hath changed ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as well of the firſt Edition, as of the Manuſcript that was diſperſed amongſt us; whether he did it of his own inclination, or to accommodate himſelf the better unto the Opinions of thoſe of his own communion, with whom he had conferred</p>
            <p>It ought not to be thought ſtrange, that thoſe who in theſe dayes publiſh Books in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Religion, ſhould with all circumſpection conſider them over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and again, and eſpecially when it is upon points of Controverſie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then a mans buſineſs is not only to eſtabliſh his own belief, but alſo to engage the contrary, which requires an exact knowledge of all the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and opinions of one and the other. But if it be true that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath a plain form of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:37449:7"/>
as the Biſhop of <hi>Condome</hi> would have us believe; if the Biſhop of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>'s Treatiſe be only a bare Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Faith, as the Title doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and as he himſelf doth declare in the beginning (<hi>pag.</hi> 2.) one would think there were not neceſſary for that, either ſubtlety, vizour, or contrivance: it would be only need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to tell us at once, with an entire ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of heart, what is believed, and the manner how it is believed; and for ſo doing, the moſt natural, and leaſt artificial manner is always beſt.</p>
            <p>I will not here ſet down the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations which the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> hath made, unto what was contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Manuſcript that was before mentioned; but I cannot paſs by with ſilence, the difference that is to be found in the firſt, and ſecond Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe nothing doth more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew the ground of their opinions, who write, than the different manner, wherein it is ſeen that they conceive the ſame things, at ſeveral times. They may to much purpoſe lay down prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and draw concluſions, form
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:37449:8"/>
Grave Debates, maintained by ſprightly figures of ſpeech, adapt terms, imploy thoſe at certain times, that are of a ſuſpended and indetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſenſe: One word naturally eſcaped doth ſay or gainſay more, than a whole Book can eſtabliſh; the very care taken in recalling ſuch a word, doth ſpeak it much the more.</p>
            <p>The greateſt part of theſe differences ſhould have been touched in the very Body of the Anſwer, in the places to which they relate, as we have tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched ſome upon the Articles of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, and the authority of the Pope: but it fell out when we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to examine this Treatiſe, we had not then the firſt Edition in our hands to compare it with the ſecond. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever though we are conſtrained to report theſe paſſages altered, without any connexion of one, with the other, or with the matters whereon they depend, and without making ſuch reflection, as otherwiſe might have been made, that hinders not, but that by the ſimple compariſon of theſe two Editions, it may be ſufficiently
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:37449:8"/>
ſeen, how that the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church hath but few of theſe worſhips and doctrines which ſeparate us from her, which do not aggrieve or create trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto the ableſt of her communion, at ſuch time as they ingage to expreſs a little clearly, what they think of them.</p>
            <p>This ſame thing may alſo work this other effect, how little ſoever equity there be in the world, that our Maſters of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church muſt more and more acknowledge, that they ought not to have a diſeſteem or averſion for us, by reaſon of ſome difference in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion touching things, of which the moſt eminent amongſt them have them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo great difficulty to ſatisfie themſelves; and the rather, becauſe they well know that they are born and bred in their belief, and with the principles, upon which their Belief is founded: whereas we are born and bred up in a Belief oppoſite, and with principles contrary unto theirs, which is the cauſe that we do feel the ſame difficulties more to the quick, than they can do.</p>

Treatiſe into the condition it is now in.</p>
            <p>The only thing to be added, in this regard, is, that though it may plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be perceived that the Biſhop of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> propoſed to himſelf two princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal ends in his Treatiſe, the one to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> diminiſhing as much as he could, what ſhe holds that is moſt violently offenſive; the other to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ours, principally upon two points, in which he believed he could have put us unto great difficulties, namely, the reality of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt in the Euchariſt, and the authority of the Church; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it appears, that it is only upon the poſitive Doctrine of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, that the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> hath ſtagger'd, that he hath touched and retouched, withdrawn, dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, or added; and finally, that he hath made all the alterations above mentioned.</p>
            <p>Now from whence could proceed this kind of variation in an Expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Faith? (for it is known how
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:37449:18"/>
well the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> is qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the great clearneſs and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs he hath in expreſſing himſelf) It cannot be ſaid, but that he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood perfectly, not only the grounds of the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but of ours alſo, four yeares paſt, when his Manuſcript Copy was diſperſed amongſt us; or ten moneths ſince, when he cauſed his Treatiſe to be printed the firſt time, as well as he knows it, at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
            <p>Therefore it muſt needs be, that theſe difficulties do proceed from the very nature of the Opinions that he laies down, which have no certain foundation, which are not conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent enough, and which have not that perfect proportion, that the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts of a Doctrine ought to have, one to the other. A man believes as the Church believes, becauſe he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves the Church cannot err. This is ſoon ſaid, but when he goes about to explain what the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> believes, by what motives, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what grounds ſhe believes, the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:37449:19"/>
mind unſatisfied knows not upon what to fix.</p>
            <p>The light of reaſon draws one way, authority draws the other; a man ſpeaks more or leſs than he would, or otherwiſe than the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent,</hi> or the Doctors, or the general practice of the people would have him ſpeak: He writes, he blots out, he corrects, endeavouring to ſatisfie all the world; and after all, he hath much ado to ſatisfie himſelf, in what is tendred unto others.</p>
            <p>However, it is certain, that there remains not now one word in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Condom</hi>'s Treatiſe, which hath not been exactly ſcann'd and placed, and therein it is without doubt, that is compriſed, what may be moſt curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and ſpeciouſly ſpoken for the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> whether we regard the opinions, whereunto the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> hath, as it were, confined himſelf, or the terms he made choice of to inſinuate his Doctrine, and to wave the difficulties which crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him moſt trouble. His Treatiſe being otherwiſe ſhort enough, it is
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:37449:19"/>
credible there could not be aſſigned a better manner of anſwering it, than that which is followed; which is not onely to alledge his opinions, and the reaſons upon which they are grounded, but almoſt throughout, the proper terms in which he concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the one, and the other. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, beſides that this is a means to lay his Treatiſe plainly before the eies of thoſe that might have forgotten part of it, or that probably might not yet have read it, the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> cannot in the leaſt ſay, that there was any deſign to conceal or cloak the ſenſe, and the force of his expreſſions; and it will alſo be ſeen more exactly, if the anſwer made unto him, be juſt, and ſufficient.</p>
            <p>The Anſwer explains it ſelf from the beginning, the particular end that is propoſed, and the order that is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
            <p>The reaſons are alſo touched which may be given, wherefore no inlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment particularly hath been made on the differences, that there might be betwixt the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi>'s

               <hi>Condom</hi>'s, and what thoſe of his com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>munion will ſpeak of their own be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lief, will be much of greater weight and leſs ſuſpected from their own mouth, than from ours.</p>
            <p>Yet it is eaſie to diſcern by reading the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi>'s Treatiſe, in the condition wherein he hath put it in this ſecond Edition, that excepting what it may be ſeen, he extenuates touching the worſhipping Saints and Images, touching the article of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions, touching that of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Maſs, and touching the authority of Popes: The difference there is betwixt his Expoſition, and and the common Doctrine of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> Church, doth principally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, in that the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:37449:20"/>
doth wrap up ſome of the moſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult things, in indefinite or general terms, and doth ſuppreſs a great number of other Doctrines that are received and believed amongſt thoſe of their Communion, as is taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of in the Anſwer.</p>
            <p>But it is no leſs eaſie to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee, by the degree the Biſhop of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> holds with thoſe of his perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that if there were a neceſsity that he ſhould explain himſelf more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly upon all theſe differences, he would not fail in all likelyhood, to give unto his expreſſions a ſenſe, that right or wrong, ſhould well agree with that of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church; and as to thoſe doctrines and practices, which he ſeems to abandon, he will ſay it may be alſo, if every one did ſpeak always as he thinks, that his intent was not to abandon them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together, but only to withdraw them for a time from our ſight, to the end to engage thoſe amongſt us, that would be inclinable, to accommodate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to theſe firſt overtures.</p>
            <p>Therefore to reduce this Anſwer
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:37449:21"/>
unto ſomething that may be leſs Sub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ject unto conteſtation, and of more certain uſe; the matter chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tended for herein is, to ſhew that the Doctrine of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, ſuch as the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> doth repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it in this Second Edition of his Treatiſe, doth nevertheleſs always overthrow the foundations of Salva<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion. Notwithſtanding to the end none may be wholy miſtaken, as to the difference there is betwixt the Biſhop of <hi>Condom's</hi> Expoſition and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Doctrin of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> beſides what hath been ſaid of this difference in ſeveral places of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, it was thought convenient here to inſert Word for Word, the form of Confeſſion of Faith by the Council, which is as it were the Abridgement of the belief of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, Thoſe that ſhall read this form with a little reflexion, will eaſily judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the mind and intention of this confeſſion, be conform in all things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the mind &amp; intention of the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi>'s Treatiſe: and thoſe of our Communion in particular, when
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:37449:21"/>
they ſhall be ſollicited to change their Religion, upon conſiderations like to theſe, which are offered in this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, will at laſt ſee, whether that which ſhall be propoſed to them to ingage them, is ſo agreeable in all points unto what they are made to promiſe, and ſolemnly ſwear, when once they are ingaged.</p>
            <p>On one ſide it is told us, that We ſhall not at all be obliged to call upon Saints, if we are not willing, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that we do not condemn theſe that do call on them; that what hath been hitherto called adoration, or Worſhipping of Images, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing properly, but an honour that is rendred unto the Originals, and an help for inſtructing the people; that works and ſatisfactions are but an application of the merits of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> In like manner the Maſs, but an application of the Sacrifice of his death; Tranſubſtantiation but a word, or expreſſion, that means nothing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all, but the reality of the body of Jeſus Chriſt in the Sacrament, which we our ſelves do alſo believe (as well
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:37449:22"/>
as the <hi>Lutherans</hi>) in receiving the ſame Sacrament, although one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a different manner; that the Cup may be given to the people for the advantage of Peace; that provided a precedency be allowed in the perſon of the Pope, for order and unity's ſake, what farther rights he pretends unto, are onely things controverted in the Schools, but do not belong unto Faith, and that that the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church do yield unto Popes but little more Authority, than we our ſelves would be willing they ſhould allow them; that to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, all theſe other Doctrines and Practices that aggrieve us, are at beſt but private opinions that may be laid aſide. This is it, they ordinarily diſcourſe to us, to make us inclinable to themſelves, and this is in particular the ſenſe and Soul of the Biſhop of <hi>Condoms</hi> Treatiſe, more openly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed and more expreſly in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript Copy, and what hath been cited of the firſt Edition, but yet clearly enough in the ſecond. On the other ſide the, profeſſion of Faith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares

in ſo many words, that we muſt <hi>believe and receive all the traditions, all the inſtitutions, &amp; all the cuſtoms of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church;</hi> which doth compriſe generally, all that is known, and that is not known. It ſaith yet more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, that <hi>we ought to pray unto Saints, to Worſhip their relicks, have Images of Jeſus Chriſt, of the Virgin, and of all the Saints, and render them the honour and the Worſhip due unto them, admit of Seven true Sacraments, and embrace all the Council of</hi> Trent <hi>hath ſaid and decided touching juſtification</hi> (and by conſequence the merit of Works, ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions, Purgatory, and all the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Indulgences) <hi>believe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of all the ſubſtance of the Bread into the body of Jeſus Chriſt, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of all the ſubſtance of the Wine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his bloud, which is called Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, and that all Jeſus Chriſt is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely received, and the true Sacrament, under the one and the other of the two</hi> ſpecies: <hi>Laſtly that we are to believe that the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is the Miſtreſs of all other Churches, to ſwear intire o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience unto the Pope of</hi> Rome <hi>and</hi> ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally

heightning the differences that there may be between his expoſition, and the Doctrine which they commonly profeſs, they would Write on the contrary in the ſame ſenſe that he doth, and clearer and fuller yet than he hath Written; that Laſtly, they would all ſay, at leaſt as he doth, that this is alone the true Doctrine of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. Religion at leaſt would find it ſelf diſcharged and freed of a great many Doctrines and practiſes, which do nothing, but burthen conſciences, &amp; this would be, in ſundry points, as one of thoſe inſenſible changes, which have come into the Church; but a change for the better, and an happy beginning of Reformation, that might have much more happy conſequences.</p>

of</hi> Rome, <hi>by explaining to us what ſhe hath defined in the Council of</hi> Trent; <hi>hoping that alone would cauſe ſundry con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts wholly to vaniſh, and that thoſe which remained, would not appear, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our own principles, of ſuch weight, as we would it ſhould be believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they are; and that according to our own principles, they contain nothing that doth wound the foundations of Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have, in the very entrance this advantage, that the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> going about to make a plain draught, as he ſpeaks, <hi>of the Catholick Doctrine,</hi> in oppoſition unto ours, lays hold on, for a foundation, a Council which is well known not to be acknowledged Catholick or Oecumenical, a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, which, above all other Councils, is ſuch wherein, according to their own Catholick Authors, there apear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed viſibly moſt of intrigue, and of human intereſts, a Council, of which our France it ſelf doth not receive all the deciſions, in matters of diſcipline and Government, a Council to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, whoſe decrees do to this day want explication.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:37449:32"/>In ſum, if the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> doth deſire that men ſhould ſpeak what they think, nothing is more frivolous than his deſign, unleſs it be for thoſe Doctrines and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes that are not very neceſſary, Whereof he ſeems to deſire to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge his Religion; for as to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Which he calls the principal cauſes of our breach, he ſaith himſelf, that the matters of controverſie are now cleared: and it is certain that there is nothing but prejudice, the weakneſs, and the variety of the mind of man, that doth hinder that all the World doth not ſo Judge. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then is it, that at this time they propoſe plainly the ſame things, as if men heeded not at all, inſtead of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of new Lights, to overcome if it might be, thoſe human infirmities which do occaſion diverſity of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>It is true that the Doctors and Preachers, of the one ſide and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, do ſometimes aggravate the things which they treat of; Whether it be the things themſelves, or the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:37449:32"/>
they draw from thence: yet this doth not hinder, but that it is very well known on both ſides, what is the ſubſtance of the belief of the one and the other in the principal points. It is properly nothing but theſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and theſe practiſes, which the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> would have laid aſide, which are not ſo well known by all the World. For example, we do very well know what the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth commonly teach con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Sacrament of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, touching the worſhipping of Saints, of the Croſs, of Images, and of Relicks, the Soveraignty of the Pope, and all the other principal points, which ſeparate us from her communion: we are ſufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, of what ſhe doth profeſs to teach, of what She receiveth, and practiſeth in all places upon theſe points: it is onely the exceſs, and abuſe, that are greater haply in ſome parts, than in others, wherein all the world doth not equally agree. We believe we have ſolidly refuted all theſe principal Doctrines, and all theſe
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:37449:33"/>
Worſhips Univerſally received: it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved him therefore properly, either to ſubmit unto our reaſons, or to ſhew better; and not put us of one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with a ſimple expoſition.</p>
               <p>It is not here put in queſtion, what power the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> hath to explain <hi>What the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>hath defined in the Council of</hi> Trent, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Doctrine unto the point, to which he ſeems to have reduced it. For our parts we do not in the leaſt make any doubt, but that Paſtours may make probable expoſitions ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the motions of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, whether it be for inſtructing their Flocks, or to bring back unto the truth ſuch as have forſaken it: for why ſhould they not explain ſuch Writings, ſeeing they do every day explain that, which is leſs clear in the Holy Scripture.</p>
               <p>But as for the Gentlemen of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> what will become of the Authentical Bull of <hi>Pius</hi> the Fourth, which doth contain the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and gives it all its authority?

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:37449:36"/>
which we draw from the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> avers, onely becauſe it pleaſeth him ſo to do,<note place="margin">P. 8</note> but direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the Doctrine it ſelf, which ſhe teacheth, and openly practices.</p>
               <p>It is true that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth teach, that we ought to Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip one onely God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, which is the firſt, and moſt fundamental Article of the Chriſtian Religion: but at the very ſame inſtant, She doth teach another Article, which is quite contrary ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to us, when She ſaith, that we ought to Worſhip, and when ſhe doth indeed Worſhip, that, which according to us, is not God.</p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> receives, as we do, the firſt Commandment of the Law, which forbids having any other God than the Mighty and Jealous God. Yet at the ſame time, She calleth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Saints, which is a Religious worſhip by their own Confeſſion, and according to us, it is a kind, or part of that worſhip, which we ought not to give but to God onely: not to ſpeak
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:37449:37"/>
here of the exceſs, which is ſeen in that worſhip.</p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> receives the ſecond Commandment, which doth particularly forbid the making Images of any thing that is in Heaven, or in the Earth, to worſhip them: but at the ſame time She doth make Images of the very perſons of the Trinity, and of all the Saints; Shee kneels down before them, and doth ſerve them Religiouſly, againſt the expreſs terms of the Commandment, and it is alſo well known, to what exceſs She hath advanced this worſhip in the practice.</p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> receives, as we do the Apoſtles Creed, which is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We pretend that to believe in God
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:37449:37"/>
the Creator, and in Jeſus Chriſt doth mean ſo to believe in God as to matter of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as not to have the Leaſt confidence in any thing elſe: and we believe that the Worſhipping of Saints, of Relicks, of the Croſs, and of Images, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the exceſs, and inevitable abuſe which follows, however the matter is ſweetned in diſputation, is a degree of a Religious confidence in the creature, which thereby doth become ſharer in what we owe only unto the Creator.</p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> with us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves that Jeſus Chriſt is aſcended into Heaven, that he ſitteth on the right hand of God the Father, and that it is he, who ſhall come from thence to judge both the quick and the dead: but ſhe believes at the ſame time, that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, is alſo every day corporally upon earth, though in an inviſible State, and different from that eſtate he is in in Heaven.</p>
               <p>Here it might be proved, that in effect all theſe Doctrines of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and ſeveral others are dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly contrary to the fundamental Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel, but that would
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:37449:38"/>
be uſeleſs in this part of the queſtion where it ſufficeth to intimate, that we do ſo believe: what follows will ſhew the reaſons which we have to believe ſo.</p>

                  <note place="margin">p. 9 a. 1</note>The Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> doth here make the objection againſt us, which is uſually made againſt us touching the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> that the conſequences which we draw from their Doctrine, do not hinder, but that we admit them into our Communion, although theſe conſequences do ſeem to deſtroy the foundation.</p>
               <p>But there is a great deal of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi>-Catholicks, in reference unto us; in effect we agree, that always heed is not to be taken of the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, which may be drawn from a Doctrin.

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:37449:38"/>
which is thought to be evil.

               <p>But as to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> it is not onely by conſequences, but by a poſitive Doctrin, and by a conſtant practice, as we pretend, whatſoever ſhe ſaith, that ſhe doth not ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledge the Soveraignty, which is due unto God, nor the quality of Saviour and Mediator in our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, nor the ſuperabundant ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his merits; becauſe it appears plainly unto us, that ſhe gives unto the creature, the Worſhip which is onely due unto the Creator: and that ſhe doth make to concur the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions and merits of men, with the ſatisfaction and merit of Jeſus Chriſt. It cannot with juſtice be ſaid that the <hi>Lutherans</hi> do not believe the humanity of Jeſus Chriſt, but it is no calumny to ſay that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth Worſhip the hoſt, and that ſhe doth give a Religious Worſhip to Saints, &amp; to their relicks, to Images, and unto the Croſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> theſe are not conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

               <p>The reformed Churches do believe, that it is not onely for the Glory of God, but that it is his will alſo, as he hath told us in his word, that we ſhould worſhip but one God, that we ſhould

ſerve none but God with a religious worſhip, that we ſhould have recourſe unto none but God only in our neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities; that we ſhould call upon none but God in our Prayers, and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, according to the very word is a ſpiritual ſacrifice, which makes up the chiefeſt part of the worſhip due unto God onely. We believe that this is the true meaning of the Commandments of the Law, and of all the Doctrin of the Goſpel, which directs us throughout, to addreſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God our vows, our Prayers and our thankſgivings; and as for the faithful Servants of God, which we eſteem to have dyed in his favour, we ſay that we ſhould honour their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories, praiſe their faith, their zeal, their charity, and all other their Chriſtian vertues, and propoſe them for example, and imitation unto the faithful. This is properly our beliefs and we are perſwaded that thoſe who will conſider it with a free and equal mind, will not onely find it ſafe, and right, but alſo pure and diſengaged from abuſe, from difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,

               <p>It will be ſaid that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> are the Inſtruments of God, and that it is God himſelf which ſpeaketh by their mouth.

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:37449:52"/>
is far from that) we do alledge in this caſe a great number which ſay the contrary.</p>
               <p>The Firſt thing, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth teach, is, that is profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to call upon the Saints, and it is certain that as to this part the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil doth ſpeak in theſe terms. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> doth a Little more ſweetten the matter in adding, that the Council <hi>is content to teach the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that this practice is good and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for them, without ſaying any thing more,</hi> and that ſo, <hi>the meaning of the Church, is to condemn thoſe who reject this practiſe through ſcorn or er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This doth manifeſtly enough de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that thoſe which are already in the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion, might ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well abſtain from all Invocation of the Saints, doing it with good inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; as for example, not to Pray but unto God alone, or not believe the invocation of Saints, to be abſolutely neceſſary; provided they do not deſpiſe, nor condemn it: that is to ſay, that the Biſhops are
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:37449:53"/>
obliged to Preach the Invocation of Saints, as the Council doth very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ordain, that we are bound to hearken unto them, and believe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo what they teach, but not to do what they teach.</p>
               <p>From whence it appears to be a ſtrange Doctrin, and a Communion very extraordinary, if it be true, that ſome may practice a Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and others may refuſe it. This doth ſufficiently make evident, that our belief and our practiſe is ſafe, and that we do follow the ſecurer Way in that regard; for if this Worſhip be <hi>but uſeful, if the Council is contented alſo to teach it ſo, without ſaying any farther,</hi> we who openly profeſs that we do not reject it through ſcorn, but only through the belief which we have, that we ought not to addreſs our vows and Prayers but to God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in appearance are not in any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of incurring Gods diſpleaſure in that behalf; eſpecially having neither Comm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> whereas the Church of

                  <hi>Rome,</hi> may well fear the jealouſie of God, if it be true as we believe, that this Worſhip is contrary to his Will.

               <p>But on the other ſide, how ſhall we reconcile the expreſſions of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> and of the Biſhop of <hi>Condom,</hi> either with the profeſſion of Faith, which the <hi>Roman</hi> Catechiſm doth preſcribe by authority of the ſaid Council, or with the opinions of the greateſt Doctors of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church and with the general practice of all thoſe of their Communion?

               </p>
               <p>In ſum, how can it be ſaid of ſuch a Religious Worſhip as this, that it is but uſeful? as if in Religion all true Worſhip, were not a true duty, and by conſequence a thing neceſſary; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially a Worſhip, which it is ſeen doth take up above half the time, of the Ceremonies, and ſervices of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion.

unto their aid, and ſuccour is not this to ſay that we ought to do it?</p>
               <p>But if any amongſt them would forbear in this matter, either becauſe they do not think it abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, or becauſe they will not addreſs their Prayers unto any but God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, how can they aſſiſt at all the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſervices where Saints are every hour called upon, without ſaying <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> as others do, or without being as it were a Sect ſeparate in the midſt of thoſe of their Communion?</p>
               <p>It is therefore moſt certain that theſe ſorts of expreſſions of the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> are only ſweetnings in terms to draw us unto a Religious ſervice, which he knows we believe to be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evil.

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:37449:59"/>
the Worſhip which is given to God, and that which is given to Saints it is this, that in truth there is much more of theſe outward things done to the Saints, than there is to God; for one Prayer addreſſed to God, how many are there addreſſed unto Saints, and particularly to the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, whether it be in the offices and Rituals, or when they ſay their beads which is as it were the meaſure of the Peoples Devotion. In <hi>Paris,</hi> for one Church conſecrated to the Name of God, there is an infinite Number to be ſeen conſecrated to the Name of Saints, and ſeveral unto the name of one Saint; a thing very different from the uſage of the firſt Ages of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which onely made mention of the Temple, or of the houſe of God, and that had not ſo much as one Temple that was conſecrated unto the Name of Angels or Saints.</p>
               <p>But Let us yet obſerve the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence there is betwixt the Churches Conſecrated unto the names of Saints, and thoſe which bear the name of God or of any of the perſons of the Holy

Trinity: For example, betwixt our Lady's, and St. <hi>Euſtace</hi>'s, on the one ſide, and St. Saviour's, and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt's, on the other: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be added to the greatneſs and magnificence of the two firſt, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther within, or in the Frontiſpiece. Theſe are the Grand Churches, here is properly the Grand devotion and concourſe of people: The others are (as it were) neglected, obſcure, and almoſt forſaken, in compariſon of the former.</p>
               <p>This, it will be ſaid, matters no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unto the Eſſence of Religion, theſe are but popular things; the Churches themſelves, though they bear the name of Saints, are firſt and principally intended to the Service of God, and all finally refers unto God, and is terminated on God.

But theſe things are onely here mentioned, to prove what hath been ſaid of the natural inclination of people, who turn their hearts, their devotion, and their dependence it ſelf ever towards the Creatures, when

they make them the object of their Religion. You may, as long as you pleaſe, diſtinguiſh betwixt a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate and an immediate object or Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, an adoration or invocation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative or ſubalternate, and abſolute or final; Say, you make a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Prayers unto Saints, and thoſe which are made to God, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to reduce thoughts and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions by the intention of the Church, or the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> or by ſome ſweetnings of expreſſions: men ſhall be judged by their own proper intentions, and not by thoſe of the Council; and not onely by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, but if they muſt render an account for every idle word, by grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reaſon, of Vows, of Incenſe, of Bowing the Knee and Prayers, or of words of Devotion, which they ſhall have addreſſed to others beſides God; and theſe very words ſhall be taken according to their natural ſenſe, and not according to a ſtrange or forced interpretation.</p>

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:37449:61"/>
unto God, it looks only to God, and fears to give unto the creature that religious honour, which is due to none but God: theirs, beſides that it is not found authoriſed by any command of God, or example of the Apoſtles, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes indeed to refer all their devotion unto God, but at the leaſt it cannot be denied, that much is loſt in the way, by the faſt hold which the people take upon the creature.</p>
               <p>As to the laſt ſweetning, which the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> uſes here for that particular worſhip, which is given to Saints, when they offer the ſacrifice of the Maſs (that is Jeſus Chriſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed) in their honour, he is pleaſed to ſay, that this is nothing but nameing the Saints as faithful ſervants of God, and praying God that he will become propitious through their interceſſion; the meer expreſſion of offering Jeſus Chriſt ſacrificed in honour of the Saints, has ſomewhat in it ſo ſtrange, &amp; abhorring from the true Spirit of the Goſpel, that we cannot imagine how Chriſtian ears could become accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it, and, leſs yet, how the Council of
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:37449:62"/>
                  <hi>Trent</hi> could prevail with themſelves to make a Doctrine or Decree of it.</p>
               <p>We have a little more enlarged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this point of the Invocation of Saints, becauſe it is one of the moſt eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential parts of their Religion, &amp; one, on which the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf has moſt inſiſted: we ſhall be more brief upon moſt of the others, as being leſs important. In the mean while it ſeems already apparent, by this ſole Article, that the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi>'s Expoſition hath nothing in it new but neat and delicate artifice, and that in concluſion it takes not off any thing from the whole force of our principal objections, nor from the number of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant controverſies; and that his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, whatſoever artifice he uſes in expreſſions, overthrows all along, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to us, the foundations of the Faith. Nay, we know not whether there be not cauſe to fear, that if on the one ſide, he had removed ſome queſtions, as it would ſeem to be his deſign by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of the way many doctrines &amp; practices of the <hi>Roman</hi> Chur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <hi>The Council doth forbid</hi> (ſaith the Biſhop of <hi>Condom) to believe any Divinity or Virtue in Images, for which there ſhould be any reverence due to them; or for which any honour ſhould be required to them, or confidence put in them, and will that all refer to the Originals which they repreſent, which doth diſtinguiſh the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>from Idolaters, becauſe very far from he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving as they, that any Divinity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides in Images, ſhe attributes no virtue unto them, but that of exciting the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the Originals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here is it notwithſtanding, and in what follows, that the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> doth ſweeten the terms, as much as he thinks may be done: it is not any longer to worſhip Images, as is the common and ordinary ſenſe of the principal Doctors who have written for this Worſhip, and of the very ſecond Council of <hi>Nice</hi> it ſelf; It is no longer to ſerve them, as yet the very termes of the

Council of <hi>Trent</hi> run, but onely to honour them. And it is true, this is, in appearance, a ſtep towards a reformation, and a ſign, that men of wiſedom and clearneſs, ſuch as the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> is, are ſomewhat aſhamed of the height whereunto they have advanced the Doctrine of this Worſhip: But in the concluſion, it is ſtill, notwithſtanding this, all one and the ſame thing, becauſe they ſtill continue to give the ſame religious Service unto Images.</p>

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:37449:64"/>
uſage, <hi>to have Images, and to worſhip them</hi> (theſe are the very words) and they authoriſe this practice by the judgment of <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> of <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine,</hi> of <hi>Vaſques,</hi> and of a great number of the chief Doctors of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. It is alſo known, that many of the ſame Doctours teach, that it is a duty to worſhip the Croſs, and the Image of Jeſus Chriſt, with the Worſhip of <hi>Latry,</hi> as they ſpeak, which yet is the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine honour that is given to God himſelf. It is ſeen, with what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion and zeal, the people kneel before the Croſs, before Images, and before Relicks; how they greet them, how they kiſs them, how they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe them, how they faſten their eyes and their hearts upon them. The Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> doth paſs all this over, by the word <hi>Honouring:</hi> it is not any longer the Croſs that is ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but <hi>he is adored before the Croſs, who did bear our ſins upon the Tree. The intention of the Church, is not ſo much to honour the Apoſtle or Martyr, as to honour the Apoſtle or Martyr in preſence
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:37449:65"/>
of the Image:</hi> which doth ſhew ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, that the Image is honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it ſelf, and that unawares they ſpeak of the preſence of the Image, as if it were animated.</p>
               <p>Beſides, this is nothing elſe but the Doctrine of the Council of <hi>Trent;</hi> it is the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> which tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, which ordains, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids; and never any one word of God, never the leaſt Commandment, nor the leaſt Example of all the Holy Scripture, of the Old or New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: that is to ſay, this is onely a Doctrine meerly humane.</p>
               <p>So far is it from being true, that God hath commanded this Worſhip, or that he hath approved it; that it hath already been ſhewed, he hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly forbidden it: and it may here be added, that all the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Law ſuppoſing great pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments againſt thoſe who violate them, this which forbids to make Images, and to ſerve them, is onely found accompanied with threatnings, unto Childrens Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of them who ſhall make Images,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:37449:65"/>
or ſerve them: as if God foreſeeing the narural inclination of men, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying them to this Worſhip, would more particularly make them know his Jealouſie, and hold back this ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency or inclination by the terrour of his Judgments.</p>
               <p>They think to avoid the meaning of the Commandment, and to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh themſelves from Pagan Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, in ſaying they do not adore the Images, and that they believe not there is any Divinity or virtue in them, as the Pagans did.</p>
               <p>But doth the Council dare ſo to reſtrain and qualifie, if it may be ſo ſaid, the expreſs Commandments of God, which not onely forbid to worſhip Images, or to believe any virtue in them, but abſolutely to make them, to worſhip, to ſerve, and to bow down before them? for the terms of the Commandment have preciſely all this.</p>
               <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> ſayes elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,<note place="margin">Pag. 80.</note> upon the words of the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Lords Supper, that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and thoſe of his Communion,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:37449:66"/>
do underſtand theſe words according to the letter, and that none ought any more to ask, <hi>Why they hold unto the literal ſenſe, than to ask of a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller, why he follows the High-way; and that it is thoſe that have recourſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a figurative ſenſe, and who follow crooked ways, that ſhould give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of what they do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, the ſenſe of the Old Teſtament is, without compariſon, more literal than that of the New; and all the World knows, that the terms of a Law or a Commandment, ſhould be more expreſs, and in a more literal ſenſe, than thoſe of a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, becauſe it behoveth neceſſarily that the Commandment be clear, to the end that all thoſe who are to keep it, may plainly underſtand it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in Myſteries, it is ſeen almoſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, that the wayes of ſpeaking are myſtical; and as the word it ſelf im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, ſignifying ſomething hid and figured. Now let the Biſhop of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> tell us here, why he doth not follow the letter of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is ſo expreſs? where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:37449:66"/>
he forſakes this High-way mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Gods own finger, to fly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a forced or alienate ſenſe.</p>
               <p>It is further but an undue impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, touching Heathens,<note place="margin">Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag. in Apol. p. <hi>17.</hi> St. Aug. in Pſal. <hi>96.</hi>
                  </note> to ſay as he doth, That they believed that their falſe Divinities did dwell in their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: the Pagans did not yield by any means, that they worſhipped wood and ſtone, but onely the Originals, which were repreſented by them. They did alſo make a great difference betwixt the Worſhip which they gave unto the great Gods, and thoſe which they gave unto the leſs Divinities: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did they believe, that their Gods were ſhut up in their Shrines, or that they <hi>dwelt in them,</hi> as the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> doth affirm; and if it be found that any ſuch thing hath been impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto them in the firſt Ages of Chriſtianity, it is onely but by reaſon, that the Superſtition of the people went much farther, than the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons &amp; Maxims of their Philoſophers, or of their Prieſts and Arch-prieſts.</p>
               <p>The Pagans believed, that their Gods came ſometimes upon earth,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:37449:67"/>
but that they made their reſidence in the Heavens, or in ſome places ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the ſight of men. <hi>Pallas,</hi> for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, could not attend to be in the <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladium</hi> in <hi>Troy,</hi> whileſt ſhe was in the <hi>Grecian</hi> Army, conducting the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot of <hi>Diomedes,</hi> and fighting againſt the <hi>Trojans</hi> themſelves.</p>

                  </note>The Pagans believed onely in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, that there was fatality or vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in the Images of their falſe Gods; as in the <hi>Palladium,</hi> the virtue of preſerving the City of <hi>Troy:</hi> and that theſe Gods did onely at ſome times, give ſome extraordinary markes of their preſence, and of their power, in their Images. Theſe things are too well known to be called in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
               <p>No more did the Iſraelites acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that they did worſhip the Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Serpent, nor the Golden Calf, nor that the Golden Calf was God himſelf; but they looked upon it as an Image or a repreſentation of that true God, that had delivered them from the Bondage of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, the Pagans and the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:37449:67"/>
Iſraelites were both alike guilty of Idolatry, by theſe two principal rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, the one, that their falſe Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, whatever it was, or whatever conſtruction they gave it, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by God: The other, that though the cleareſt amongſt the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, and amongſt the Iſraelites, did ſay in general, that they did not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, neither the Images of falſe Gods, nor the Braſen Serpent, nor the Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Calf, the people, nevertheleſs, did not forbear to give a Religious Service unto thoſe things, to kneel before them, to incenſe them, and in ſome meaſure, to faſten their truſt and affections upon them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Roman</hi> Church doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve any Divinity in the Images: it is true; except haply ſome groſſer Spirits, which are capable of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing, when they are kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before them, and are poſſeſſed with the wonders that have been done by the Images.</p>
               <p>But how can it ſo formally be ſaid, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth not believe that there is any virtue in

in ſtead of ſacrifices, and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, of the ancient Covenant, we have Jeſus Chriſt, which hath offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf upon the Croſs; and in ſtead of the Paſſeover, and Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the Sacraments of Baptiſm, and the Lords Supper.

               </p>
               <p>But in the firſt place, as to inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, if they will own the truth, the people is no where worſe inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the true myſteries of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than in thoſe places where the Worſhip of Images is moſt urged, as in <hi>Muſcovia.</hi> They have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſay, that Images are the Books of the ignorant, that is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:37449:71"/>
mean, which the ſlothfulneſs or ignorance of thoſe, who ought to inſtruct the people themſelves, have ſubſtituted in the place of true and ſound inſtructions. Every one may ſee, that our Reformed People who have no Images, nor other exerciſe, but our Prayers, our ſinging of Pſalms our Sermons, the reading of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures, and the Sacraments ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred in the ſame ſimplicity, that our Lord did inſtitute them, are not leſs inſtructed, than thoſe of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church with their Images. The Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> knows as well as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man, that, in truth, it is by prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, that there ſhould be formed in the hearts of men, the lively Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Jeſus Chriſt, who died for us, and (if we will have them) the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the life and death of holy men, who have ſealed the Truth with their bloud, and the Holineſs of their life.</p>
               <p>And as to matter of devotion, the ſame is alſo ſeen, that the people which uſe Images, and all the other ceremonies where with Religion is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbred,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:37449:71"/>
have, it may be, more of the outward appearances of zeal, but not therefore a more ſolid piety to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God; and on the contrary, all their devotion is turned towards theſe outward things,<note place="margin">Concil. Trid. Seſs. <hi>25.</hi> de invoc. Sanct. Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum. Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctae.</note> and towards the Images themſelves. That is, in a word, that the Images being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly onely for the people (as the Council doth intimate) and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple almoſt alwayes abuſing them (as the moſt ſincere perſons do confeſs) the Images, therefore, are properly onely for thoſe who abuſe them.</p>
               <p>As to what concerns Reliques, it will onely be needful to apply hereto, what hath been ſpoken in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and in particular; touching the object of Religious Worſhip, and touching the invocation of Saints, and the veneration that is given to Images. For, as to the Doctrine, we have almoſt the ſame reaſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all theſe different obiects of Worſhip: And, as to the practice, all the World knows, that there are yet far greater abuſes committed in the Worſhip of all that they call Reliques
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:37449:72"/>
of Saints, than in that of Images.</p>
               <p>What we have in particular, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Reliques, may be reduced unto two principal Heads; the firſt, that neither the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> nor the Catechiſm, nor the Biſhop of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> ſay, that Reliques have no vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, nor that we ought not to place confidence in them, as they all do ſay of Images.<note place="margin">Ibid. de <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Sanct. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> de cultu Sanct.</note> On the contrary, the Council teacheth, <hi>that God confers ve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry great graces by means of Reliques;</hi> and the Catechiſm ſpeaks ſtronger, and more openly; <hi>that God makes uſe of them to heal the lame and the blind, to raiſe the dead, and to exorciſe devils, and to drive them out of the bodies of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving men.</hi> By which paſſages, the Council, and the Catechiſm, on the one hand, recommend the Worſhip of Reliques, above that of Images, for the virtue which they would have believed to be in Reliques: And on the other hand, themſelves, in ſome meaſure overthrow, the principal reaſon, which they alledge to juſtifie the Worſhip of Images, which is, that they believe there is no virtue in them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:37449:72"/>As for the Biſhop of <hi>Condom,</hi> he ſhelters himſelf from all theſe difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in not ſaying, whether there is, or is not, any virtue in Reliques. And here is the ſecond thing, which is to be obſerved, touching Reliques in particular, that the Biſhop of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> ſeems not to conſider them, but as marks of reverence and affection, which are borne for the perſons we love and honour. From whence he draws this conſequence, <hi>That if God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>all jealous as he is of the love of men, doth not look upon us, as if we divided betwixt him and the creature, when we love our neighbour for his ſake; the ſame God, howſoever jealous of the reſpect of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, doth not behold them, as if they divided the Worſhip which they owe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him alone, when they honour, for the reſpect which they bear unto him, thoſe whom he himſelf hath honoured.</hi> And in the end he concludes, <hi>that theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward marks of reverence not being abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely nec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

be ſervilely ſubject unto viſible things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All the World may ſee, how this diſcourſe is turned and ſweetned, and how it ſeems to open a way to ſome Reformation: but if theſe opinions be ſincere, and approved by all thoſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion, let them, at leaſt, make appear, that their actions do anſwer their words. If they will onely honour the Saints, the true honour of dead bodies is burial; and as for apparel, and other things, which ſerved for their uſe, let them be carefully preſerved, if they pleaſe, but let them not incenſe them, and let them not expoſe them in the Houſe of God, to become an object of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Let them not ſuffer the people to truſt in Reliques, that they ſhould carry them with them, as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervatives againſt danger of Fire, of Shipwrack, and againſt the Devil himſelf; and that thereby, <hi>their hearts cleaving unto the things which they have before their eyes,</hi> they become more negligent of praying unto God, and having recourſe to him alone. No perſons have greater reſpect and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:37449:73"/>
for the memory of Saints, than we have; let there be no mixture of Religion, nor Worſhip, no not the very terms: for, as for us, it is our unmovable Foundation, that God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone ought to be the object of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilion, and that there ought not to be any ſort of Religious Worſhip given to any, but unto God onely.</p>
               <p>God will have us to love our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, which are <hi>living members</hi> of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and which are not things inanimate, or the dead parts of living members, as are the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques; for this is the reaſon, for which the Council will have men to have a veneration for them. But who doth not know, that even in this love for our neighbours, there may be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and that God may be diſpleaſed thereat. God permits us to love goods, and riches, as gifts from his hand, but this love doth often extend too far, and God is offended at it. The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture calls coveteouſneſs Idolatry; &amp; we every day ſay, that men do ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize what they love, when they love it to exceſs. It is the ſame thing, in a
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:37449:74"/>
manner, as to the honour that is due to Saints. God will have us to love and honour their memory, that we ſhould praiſe them, that we ſhould propoſe to imitation their Faith, their Zeal, that their names ſhould be in venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and bleſſing amongſt us: but he will not we obſerve no meaſure, he will not have us give unto them the ſame marks of Honour, as we give unto himſelf; and he not onely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids that we ſhould divide this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour betwixt him and the Saints, but he will alſo have us not communicate the leaſt part of it unto any but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alone.</p>
               <p>Now to end this article of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Saints, of Reliques, and of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, if the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> will do any thing that is ſincere and ſolid, if he will cure the diſeaſe, and not palliate it; that is, if he will leave the Foundations of Faith whole, and intire, and diſpel a conſiderable part of our Controverſies, as he ſaith it is his deſign to do, it is not enough to change ſome terms, or to faſten them; nor to inſinuate, as he doth, that the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:37449:74"/>
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> may uſe ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration <hi>in the outward ſigns of this Worſhip,</hi> whileſt in the general, it is ſeen, that at the bottom, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and practice of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, is all along one and the ſame.</p>
               <p>As for us, though it may ſeem that there is leſs appearance of evil and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, in the manner of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Condom</hi>'s ſpeaking, than there is in that of the Council, of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catechiſm, and the other Doctours of his Communion, we can look nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon the one nor the other but onely as humane inventions. And to conclude, theſe very ſweetnings of the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> himſelf, being far from giving us any ill opinion of our Reformation, rather confirm us the more, that the worthy and moderate perſons of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, do them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, at leaſt, condemn a good part of what we condemn, and that by conſequence, they acknowledge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by in ſome ſort, that a Reformation is uſeful and neceſſary.</p>

               <p>It is true, as the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> ſaith, that the Article of Juſtification is one of the chief things which gave occaſion of reformation to our Fathers. Very few are Ignorant what was the ſtate of the Latin church at that time. On one hand preſented it ſelfe the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of the merit of works, the neceſſity of ſatisfying Gods Juſtice in this life, or endureing the fire of Purgatory after death, to compleat what was want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this ſatisfaction; on the other hand was to be ſeen an extraordinary irregulatity in the life and manners, as well of the Clergy, as of the people; and by conſequence no likelihood of ſalvation neither by works, nor by thoſe ſatisfactions: and in fine there appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no other Object before the eyes of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:37449:75"/>
men, but Purgatory, or Hell.</p>
               <p>In this ſtate of the Church, the Pope opens the Treaſures of his Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, diſtributes his Agnus's, his Beads, and Reliques, and preſcribes certain numbers of <hi>Pater noſters,</hi> and <hi>Ave Mary's,</hi> of Stations, of Viſits of Churches, of Pilgrimages, Faſts, Pennances, of macerations and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications; with which, and with the help of Pardons, Diſpenſations, and Indulgences, which were pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed at a dear rate, thoſe who had them were not onely juſtified them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but helped to juſtifie others, delivering ſouls out of Purgatory, and acquiring for them a greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of bleſſedneſſe, or an augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of glory, as the Councill ſpeaks. Our Fathers did believe, that there was an abuſe in all theſe things, and that this Doctrine which poſſeſſed the minds of the people, and that made up the greateſt part of their pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, did overthrow the Foundation of Religion, which doth eſſentially conſiſt, in placing our chiefeſt confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the Death of our Lord Jeſus
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:37449:76"/>
Chriſt; and farther, in ſerving God according to his will, and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the commandments of men.</p>
               <p>It is alſo true, that ſince the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf doth ſeem to be a little more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, than ſhe was before, as well as to expreſſions, in regard of her Doctrines, as in regard of the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, and the very uſe of Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and they are beholding to us for it, which doth very much ſerve for the juſtification of our firſt Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers; but the abuſes are yet too great in one, and the other, for the corrupting of piety, and ſcandalizing of true Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who onely conſider the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie of Juſtification at a diſtance, or tranſiently, without ſearching in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the grounds and conſequences, will not, it may be, at firſt, think it ſo important as it is: but it is of ſo great moment, what herein is the judgment of thoſe, who are well informed amongſt us, that as to the contrary, we ſhould not ſtick here
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:37449:76"/>
to maintain, that the difference of Belief, which doth ſeparate us from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as to this point, is of ſo great conſequence unto Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that there is ſcarce any great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
               <p>Let us therefore be permitted, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the liberty that Diſpute doth require, to deny here formally what the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> doth aver in ſomething an uncertain manner, <hi>That there are but few learned men of our ſide</hi> (as he ſpeaks) <hi>but do confeſs, that we ought not to ſeparate from the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>about this point, and that this difficulty is not any longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as much material, by the moſt intelligent perſons amongſt us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> doth not cite one of thoſe learned men, nor one of thoſe intelligent perſons, unto whom he imputes theſe ſorts of Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, as the importance of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs doth require. The Confeſſion of Faith of our Churches, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the General Belief of thoſe of our Communion, explains it ſelf to the contrary upon this point, as
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:37449:77"/>
throughly as may be: it confirms the very Doctrine, which the firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers taught, declaring in expreſs terms, <q>That how little ſoever we ſwerve from this Foundation, we can never finde any eaſe, but that we ſhall be continually toſſed with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietude.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> it ſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the importance of this Controverſie; Firſt, in that it takes notice of it from the firſt, as one of the principal cauſes of the Schiſm, and which did moſt deſerve the care of the ſaid Council: And in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place, by the prodigious length of its Decree, and by the vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of its Canons and Anathema's, much greater upon this point, than upon any other.</p>
               <p>In ſumme, it may be ſaid, that it is not onely a principal point, but it is one of them which are moſt ſuch. The others, for the moſt part, do onely regard ſome part of Religion: Errour doth corrupt but that part, and doth not influence the others, if we may ſo ſpeak. The worſhipping
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:37449:77"/>
the Hoſt, for example, is, without doubt, one of the moſt eſſential points, in which it is impoſſible to finde any mean, becauſe the queſtion is, whether it ought to be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or not worſhipped, which is the firſt and greateſt Act of Religion: Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, this is but a particular point; a capital errour indeed for them, who are deceived in it, but which doth nothing, or changeth nothing, in all the other Fundamental Points.</p>
               <p>But who ſpeaks of Juſtification, ſpeaks of the means of our Salvation, that is to ſay, the Myſtery of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; there is nothing more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant, than not to be deceived in the choice of ſuch a matter, becauſe if a man fails to take the right way, he falls from errour to errour, and the very true eſſence of Religion is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and altered.</p>
               <p>This truth will plainly appear, by the bare comparing of our Doctrine with that of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We do believe, that our Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth alone conſiſt herein, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving deſerved death, Jeſus Chriſt dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:37449:78"/>
for us, and ſatisfied the Juſtice of God the Father for us, who for the love of his Son, pardoneth all our ſins in general, uniting us unto him by a true and lively faith, and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his righteouſneſs and obedience unto us, that is to ſay, the merit of his Death it ſelf, as though we had ſuffered it in our own perſons. We believe that it is God himſelf, that doth beget and ſtrengthen this Faith in our hearts, by the inward opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Holy Spirit, and by the outward Miniſtry of his Word and Sacraments, as ſhall be explained in what follows, upon the ſubject of the Sacraments; that this Faith is not a dead, or idle Faith, but a living Faith, and <hi>working by love, and by all ſorts of good works,</hi> and that theſe works are very acceptable to God, and neceſſary to Salvation, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable conſequent of that Faith which juſtifies us; but that it is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of pure Grace and by the alone merit of the death of J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> us our ſins, and give us everlaſting Life. Laſtly, we
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:37449:78"/>
believe, that we ought to be ſo far from making the goodneſs and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God a motive of ſin, or of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecting good works, that we ought, on the contrary, to make it a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of Love, of Fear, of Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and of an humble obedience unto all his commandments.</p>
               <p>This is the ſumme of our Doctrine, wholly conformable to the Spirit of the Goſpel, worthy of the infinite goodneſs of God, and of the honour that we have of being his children, and which alſo leaveth unto him all the glory of our Salvation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by puts us, by its very own nature, under an indiſpenſable obligation of being an holy people, and of doing his Will.</p>
               <p>There are other Doctrines which do proceed from hence, or relate hereto, whereof it is true, that many times the diſpute is only of words; and it ſeemeth, that a man may be in an errour, as to ſome of theſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, without derogation from the Glory of God, or prejudicing the rule of our conduct: as, touching
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:37449:79"/>
the aſſurance which Believers may have of their Election, and touching the ſenſe wherein it is ſaid, that God doth recompenſe our good works: but as to what concerns thoſe due ſentiments, which we laid down, touching the onely cauſe of our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, namely, the Bloud of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which blotteth out our ſins, without our bringing any thing on our parts, but that grace wherewith he himſelf makes us to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the merits of his Death, as it is the Foundation of the love and regard which we owe unto him, ſo alſo of the quiet of our own conſciences: and not to think of God on this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, as highly as may be, and as we are thereby bound; or to diminiſh directly or indirectly, by our thoughts or expreſſions, the leaſt point of this glory (which he hath to be the onely Authour of our Salvation) or of the obligation which we have towards him, is to offend his Divine Majeſty in the moſt tender part, as we may ſo ſay, of that love which he himſelf hath for us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:37449:79"/>We have this advantage on this point, as on many others, that the Gentlemen of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church do agree almoſt to all that we believe: the diſpute is, for the moſt part, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touching what they add unto that which we believe. They confeſs, as we, that God is the onely Authour of our Salvation; and it would be ſaid at firſt ſight, that all which the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> hath ſet forth as to his Belief, touching Juſtification, doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely agree with our Doctrine; for he ſaith as we do, <hi>That our ſins are freely forgiven unto us, through the Divine mercy, for his Son Jeſus Chriſt's ſake, who blotted them out by his own Bloud.</hi> He ſaith alſo, <hi>that the righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt is imputed unto us,</hi> which is an expreſſion we ordinarily keep our ſelves to, according to the ſtile of Scripture, for the better underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the very Word, the nature and means of Juſtification. The Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> in particular, do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly decline this expreſſion, becauſe it intimates openly enough, that
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:37449:80"/>
it is not by any righteouſneſs, that is in us, that we are juſtified, but by that righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt which is out of us, and which is made ours by imputation: as the Money which is paid by the ſurety, is made the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>btors, or reputed to be his; becauſe the Creditor is accountable for it, and diſchargeth him of his debt. Thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> do not at all accommodate themſelves unto this manner of thinking or ſpeaking, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they joyn unto this Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Jeſus Chriſt, that is imputed unto us, a righteouſneſs, that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and inherent in us, as they ſay, which doth concur with the former. This it is, which is properly the ground of the Queſtion betwixt them and us, and the ſource of ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Doctrines, which we do reject, as ſhall be ſpoken in the following Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>However, it is true, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> here ſeems to advance a ſtep towards us: at leaſt, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that he hath done much good to Religion in general, in diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:37449:80"/>
it in ſome ſort, from all the vain ſpeculations, not onely of the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, but alſo of the Council it ſelf, which is evidently as much or more Scholaſtical on this point of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the moſt thorny School-Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors. The Decree contains no leſs than ſixteen great Chapters, and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty two Canons, to which the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pters of the Decree are reduced. The Decree is full of diſtinctions of the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal cauſe, the efficient cauſe, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious cauſe, the formal cauſe, the inſtrumental cauſe, and the like; the Canons full of <hi>Anathema's</hi> againſt a great many opinions, if not good or innocent (being yet in diſpute) at leaſt doubtful and indifferent, and which are viſibly of the opinions of thoſe particular Doctours, which the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> would with good reaſon have laid aſide: the Council thereby making Articles of Faith, of all thoſe ſubtilties in Canoniſing them, and by this means putting an invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble obſtacle unto a reunion, by the great number of <hi>Anathema's</hi> which it thunders generally againſt all thoſe,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:37449:81"/>
who will not admit all theſe opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and diſtinctions of the Schools.</p>
               <p>Our Confeſſion of Faith, reduces all this matter of Juſtification, unto a few Articles, in Apoſtolical ſtile, very ſimple, and very clear. And the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> doth alſo reduce the very Chapters of the Decree, and all the Canons, unto a few words; ſo far we ſeem to go, as it were, hand in hand.</p>
               <p>But it muſt needs be, that the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> doth us, is not ſincere; what he gives us with one hand, he taketh away at the ſame time with the other: and it may be ſaid, that this is ſtill one of thoſe Articles of Faith, which the <hi>Roman</hi> Church receives as we do, well nigh as fundamental, but from whence, at the ſame time, ſhe derogates by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Doctrines.</p>
               <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> ſaith here, <hi>That God doth freely forgive us our ſins, and that he blots them out by the bloud of his Son.</hi> In the following Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons it will appear, that theſe ſins are not ſo forgiven, nor ſo blotted out,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:37449:81"/>
but that we are bound neceſſarily to ſatisfie our ſelves <hi>by temporal pains in this life,</hi> by the torments of <hi>Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> in the other; or <hi>by the Pardons and Indulgences</hi> of the Holy Chair: and from hence, without going farther, having ſaid that our ſins are blotted out by the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt, he immediately adds, <hi>and by the Grace which regenerates us.</hi> Now here we muſt obſerve, that it is the conſtant Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that it is in our power to reject this grace, or accept it, when it is offered unto us; and that then, when it falls out that we do not reject it, but receive it, and afterward act of our ſelves with the aſſiſtance of this grace, we have a proper merit of our own, and ſome part in the Work of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though it ſhould be onely for not having rejected it.</p>
               <p>And though it ſeem at firſt ſight, that there is not in this point ſo great a difference betwixt the Gentlemen of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church and us, it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, upon very i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>flection made thereon, that as to the Foundation,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:37449:82"/>
this difference is very great, as well upon the points of their Doctrine in this very matter, as upon all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther points that proceed from it.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, he buſies himſelf more or leſs, touching the ſincerity and purity of thoughts which we ought to have, not onely of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God, but more particularly of his grace and infinite goodneſs, which could make us without us, and which will yet ſave us, in ſome ſenſe, not onely without our ſelves, as when he is found of them which ſeek him not, but alſo often maugre our ſelves as when he doth touch the hearts of; thoſe which perſecute his Church, which in effect is, what the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion hath, more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, moſt eſſential, and moſt admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. We have nothing upon this point, but to compare our Sentiments with thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to ſee which are moſt conformable unto this fair Idea of the great mercy of God, which makes him to extend his benefits and compaſſions even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe very perſons who reſiſt him.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:37449:82"/>1. We attribute all unto God, in the Work of our Salvation, without deſiring to take any thing unto our ſelves; and albeit this very thing were true, that we could pretend unto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſmall part, yet upon the whole, the errour may not be criminal. It may, on the contrary, be eſteemed profound humility, and an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of our nothingneſs; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, whatever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation ſhe makes, that ſhe alſo at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes all to God, as we do, ſticks not nevertheleſs to attribute unto man, a great part of the merit and honour of his Salvation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In aſcribing all unto God, as we do, and in renouncing our ſelves, we aſſure the quiet of conſcience, becauſe thereby we put all the confidence of our Salvation in the goodneſs of God, and in the merits of his Son's Death, which is an unſhakeable Foundation; whereas the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> gives man an opinion of his own ſtrength, which, on the one ſide, cannot but diminiſh, in ſome ſort, that intire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence which he ought to have in the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:37449:83"/>
bloud of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and on the other ſide, make him promiſe himſelf much from his Faſts, and from his other good Works, like the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee in the Goſpel: and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this, he ceaſeth not to be miſerably perplexed in this life, or at his death, with fears of Purgatory, or of Hell, when he comes to perceive his weakneſs, and to think that it was partly in his power to have ſaved himſelf.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Our Belief doth very ſtrictly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage us, by all the ſtrongeſt bands of Love, and Gratitude, to Worſhip God, and to ſerve him, and to keep his Commandments, with ſo much the more care and zeal, as he ſaveth us by his pure grace, overcoming the very oppoſition of our Will. The Doctrine of the Gentlemen of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church, doth alſo ingage them to the ſame Duty, but it diminiſheth much herein, by ſuppoſing that they are ſomething beholding unto their own natural ſtrength: and beſides this, it mingles with this duty, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of Hope of good, and fear of
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:37449:83"/>
evil, which in their nature would not be amiſs, were it as eaſie, as it is difficult, to keep them within juſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration; which nevertheleſs are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways more of the diſpenſation of the Law, than of the true Spirit of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>The onely or the principal thing, which is alledged againſt us upon this Article of Juſtification, is, that they pretend that our Doctrine referring, as it doth, our Salvation wholly to the mercy of God, and to the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which is imputed unto us, it ſeems to put men at liberty, or at leaſt under a relaxation from good Works; as if they had nothing to do on their part, or that it ought to be indifferent unto them, whether they did good or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</p>
               <p>But we have already prevented this Objection, by giving to underſtand, that being very far from making the mercy of God an occaſion of ſin, and negligence, we ſay with <hi>David,</hi> that <hi>there is mercy with God, that he may be feared.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:37449:84"/>And beſides, though there be but too much of vice and ſin in us, as we do not preſume that our manners are better than thoſe of <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks; we can ſay, for the defence of our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that it cannot be ſeen that we are much more wicked or extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant than they, whether the people or Clergy be regarded.</p>
               <p>We, on our ſide, do yet oppoſe unto the Gentlemen of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, that their Belief doth produce two infallible evil effects; it caſts ſome into a preſumption of their own me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, from whence proceed Vows, Abſtinences, Macerations, and other the like practices, which we believe ſuperſtitious, and contrary to the Word of God; and it precipitates others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to deſpair, by the reſentment they have of their own weakneſs, from whence proceeds their recourſe unto Saints, Purgatory, Indulgences, and all thoſe other Doctrines and Practices; which we believe to be contrary unto true piety.</p>
               <p>It may therefore be ſeen by the bare comparing of our Doctrine with that
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:37449:84"/>
of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which of the two doth moſt tend unto the glory of God, and to form the moſt pure and diſintereſſed thoughts in our hearts; and if in the end, the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence which there is betwixt the one and the other, doth not induce any very conſiderable change in Religion, this will yet farther appear, in exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning other Doctrines, which in ſome ſort, depend upon Juſtification.</p>
               <p>The firſt,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>VII.</hi> The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Works.</note> in the Biſhop of <hi>Condom's</hi> order is the merit of Works, upon which we confeſs ſincerely, that the Biſhop of <hi>Condom,</hi> and thoſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, who diſcover the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt ſentiments of Free Grace, ſpeak almoſt every where as we do. We a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with them in the principal, which is, that good Works are not only well pleaſing unto God, but neceſſary to Salvation: Nor do we deny, either one or the other, that God doth crown his gifts and his graces, and that, according to his promiſes, he doth freely reward thoſe who ſerve him. In ſumme, it would ſeem, that this Doctrine were ſufficient to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:37449:85"/>
in our hearts the true love of Righteouſneſs, and hatred of Sin; and here it is properly, that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute is onely touching words. This term of <hi>merit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mereri.</note> which hath been intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced onely by an ill interpretation of the Latin, hath indeed thus much of diſguſt, that on the one hand, it ſeems to make our weak endeavours to concur with the merit of the bloud of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, and to ſuppoſe ſome proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt our Works, and eternal Life: and on the other hand, it puffs up that arrogancy, unto which man is naturally too much inclined. But theſe Gentlemen do in ſome ſort ſalve the former of theſe inconveniences, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring as they do, that they do not attribute any merit unto Works, but by virtue of the free promiſe, which God hath made to reward them, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing them himſelf in us by his grace; and beſides the moderate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons amongſt them, do not diſſent, but that theſe ſorts of expreſſions of <hi>merit,</hi> may very well be waved, and that ours are more humble and more
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:37449:85"/>
ſafe: as alſo on our part we do not deny, but that thoſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, may be ſuffered in the ſenſe wherein they now explain them. And it may be this is it, which the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> doth here under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, when he ſaith, that the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of our Communion do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ſome of our Diſputes upon this point, to be very material.</p>
               <p>What is here moſt myſterious, is, that upon this expreſſion, that good Works do merit eternal life, there are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ounded two other Doctrines which are very evil. The firſt is, that they are not contented to command works that are truly good and commanded, as to worſhip God onely, to ſerve none but him, to obey our Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, and laſtly, to love God with all our hearts, and our Neighbour as our ſelves, which is the ſumme of the Law, and of Chriſtian Religion; but they have brought in the practice of Vows, of Abſtinences, of Pilgrimages, Macerations, and all thoſe other Works, which the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> doth call <hi>Pennances,</hi> becauſe in very
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:37449:86"/>
deed, God hath not required any of that nature.</p>
               <p>The other evil Doctrine which proceeds from the merit of Works, is that of Satisfaction, of Purgatory, and Indulgences; for thoſe who do theſe <hi>Works</hi> of Pennance, believe they ſatisfie, at leaſt in ſome part, the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God; and therefore it is, that they call them <hi>Satisfactions:</hi> and thoſe who do none of them, believe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves deſtin'd to the pains of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and have recourſe unto Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences to deliver them.</p>

               <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> ſaith on the contrary, <hi>that God doth pardon our ſins, but upon ſuch condition, under ſuch Law, and with ſuch reſervation as he pleaſeth; that he confers an intire abolition of all ſins committed for Baptiſm; but as for thoſe that are committed after Baptiſm, God forced by our ingratitude, changes the eternal pain into a temporal.</hi> This is, what the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> calls re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the ſin, and retaining the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</p>
               <p>This is to ſay, that God doth par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and he doth not pardon; or at leaſt, that he doth not fully pardon. Our ſins, all blotted out as they are, do nevertheleſs cry for vengeance. It is not enough, that Jeſus Chriſt hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toned for them, nor that we repent, and endeavour to amend, and to keep the Commandments of God, if toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther herewith we do not Works, which the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> calls painful
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:37449:87"/>
and laborious, or if we, ſuffer not temporal pains, either in this life, or after death. This is what hath been already touched; the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is not onely injurious unto the mercy of God, and unto the merit of the death of Jeſus Chriſt, by the conditions and reſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which ſhe preſumes to bring thereunto, but ſhe contradicts her ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſelf, pulling down with one hand, what ſhe builds up with another. On the one hand, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt hath fully payed the price of our ranſome; there is nothing wanting of this payment, his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice is imputed unto us, our ſins are blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out by his bloud. In a word, Jeſus Chriſt hath fully ſatisfied for us.</hi> And on the other hand,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 60, <hi>&amp;</hi> 61.</note> 
                  <hi>the juſtice of God, and a certain way which he hath appointed, will have us not to ſuffer our ſelves for our ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> would ſalve this contradiction, by ſaying, as he doth, that theſe pains which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, are onely to keep us <hi>in our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> within <hi>the hands of Juſtice,</hi> as he ſpeaks, and not to ſatisfie for our ſins:
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:37449:87"/>
therefore it is that he makes a kind of proteſtation, that if after the explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which he gives in that ſenſe, <hi>We ſhall object unto thoſe of his Communion, that they do prejudice unto the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Jeſus Chriſt; that we muſt forget what he hath already told, us that Jeſus Chriſt has paid the full price of our ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and that if we yet object to them, that they believe they ſhall be able to ſatisfie of themſelves, as to ſome part of the pain which is due to their ſins, he may boldly ſay, that the contrary doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by the Maxims which he hath eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed.</hi> Unto which he adds for a concluſion, <hi>That what they call ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, with the ancient Church, is nothing,</hi> AFTER ALL, <hi>but an application of the infinite ſatisfaction of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may plainly be ſeen by theſe laſt expreſſions of the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi>'s, that he ſeemes to doe like the Dove, which returned unto the Ark not knowing where to reſt her foot. AF<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER ALL, <hi>what they call ſatisfaction, is nothing but the application of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> This expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath ſomething in it improper, and
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:37449:88"/>
incumbred, becauſe it cannot be any thing but Faith onely, which is the hand of the Soul, that can apply unto us the ſatisfaction of Jeſus Chriſt, by acts of love, and reliance. It cannot properly be ſaid, that any Workes done by us, or that any pain that we ſuffer, can be the application of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, which Jeſus Chriſt rendred unto his Father, and of the paines which he ſuffered for us.</p>
               <p>The truth is, that the Biſhop of <hi>Condom,</hi> after having defended as much as he could, the opinions and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> will give to underſtand, that AFTER ALL, what they call ſatisfactions, are not properly ſatisfactions: that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves do not believe they can ſatisfie, as they juſt now ſaid more expreſly, and that in concluſion, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing really but the ſatisfaction of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, which ought to be called by this name. This Doctrine is ſound, and it is certain, that it is in ſome ſort to come unto us, or rather to the truth of the Goſpel; but this is nothing in the main, if the Doctrine of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil

to their ſins.</hi> This is ſo clear and expreſs, that nothing can be more.</p>
               <p>In very deed, this Doctrine of the Council, is the common and conſtant Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> upon this point:<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>1.</hi> de Purg. ca. <hi>14.</hi>
                  </note> inſomuch that <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> by a ſubtilty contrary to that of the Biſhop of <hi>Condoms,</hi> doth teach that it is we, who, properly ſatisfy for our ſins, and that the ſatisfaction of Jeſus Chriſt onely puts a value upon ours: The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> therefore ought either to make all thoſe of his communion to relinquiſh this Doctrin of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, which is the common and conſtant Doctrine of their Church, or to come to an accord, that even by his own judgment, we have right to charge them with the two things that have been touch'd; The one, that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth contradict it ſelf; and the other, that they believe to ſatisfie at leaſt in part, for their ſinns, &amp; that by conſequence they do injury unto the infinite ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> did not judge it for his purpoſe, to ſpeak more
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:37449:89"/>
openly, what thoſe painful and labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious works, and thoſe ſatisfactory pains are, whereof here is queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: it might be ſaid, that theſe are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily of the number of thoſe things, which muſt be little explained; and which are much better when they are lightly paſſed, or wrapped up in general terms. It would indeed ſeem, that the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> hath intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced this term of <hi>painful and labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous works,</hi> in the room of what the <hi>Roman</hi> Church directly calls <hi>penal works,</hi> or <hi>pennances</hi> and <hi>ſatisfactions.</hi> There is much difference betwixt the one and the other; the one imports on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly difficult works, the other puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and it may plainly be ſeen by what hath been ſaid, that this altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the expreſſions, doth onely proceed from the alteration which the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> hath made in the common Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to conclude, by what name ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are called, we know they are ſuch kind of works whereof we have already ſpoken, Vows, Pilgrima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:37449:90"/>
Viſits of Churches, Abſtinences Prayers by ſet-number, Hair ſhirts Sack-clothes, going without Shirts, lying hard, and ſuch other Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in this life; and at laſt, the paines of Purgatory in the other.</p>
               <p>Now if it be here demanded, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be not ſome authority for all theſe Doctrines, the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> produces not any. It only ſaith, that in the Old Teſtament there are ſome examples of perſons, whom God hath puniſhed with temporal paines, though he had forgiven them their ſin; and that it ſeems to ſuit with the juſtice of God, that it ſhould be one kind of Grace which he ſhewes unto thoſe who have ſinned before Baptiſm, and another which he ſhews to thoſe who have ſinned after Baptiſm. The Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> ſaith the ſame, that this is juſt, that this is a certain Order eſtabliſhed; as when God doth forgive us the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> and yet for all that not free us from the maladies which are the conſequent of that ſin.</p>
               <p>This is the onely ground, and ſole authority that they give us, for ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:37449:90"/>
a Doctrine as is that of Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions; that is to ſay, an argument meerly humane, without any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand or precept in Scripture: as if the evils and corrections which God ſends us to exerciſe our faith and patience, were not at all effects of his love, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than puniſhments, or as if this were a title or reaſon for us to give our ſelves diſcipline, as they ſpeak, or to torment our ſelves, and attempt in ſome ſort upon our own lives.</p>
               <p>As to us, who have onely the will and Word of God for the rule of our manners and actions, as well as of our Faith, we are perſwaded that all theſe Works which God hath not comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, being very far from pleaſing, do offend him; that all this appearance of devotion, is nothing elſe but an imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Sect of the Phariſees, which corrupted the Law by their Traditions, faſting formally twice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>week: The abſtinence from meats, in particular, is an imitation of the Sect of the <hi>Pythagoraeans,</hi> which fed on no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Herbs: Whippings and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerations, an imitation of the Prieſt of

               <p>We have the ſame things to ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Purgatory, as againſt Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; it is alſo a Doctrine which dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates from the merit of the death of Jeſus Chriſt, as if the expiation which he made of our ſins, were imperfect, &amp; that there were need that we ſhould compleat it. There is no track of Purgatory to be found in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:37449:91"/>
whether of the Old or New Teſtament, without forced interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and conſequences, whereof our Doctours have ſufficiently ſhew'd the vanity. Many alſo of themſelves, of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> accord, that for this Doctrine they have nothing but Tradition, ſince the time of <hi>Gregory</hi> the firſt, who wrote in the end of the Sixth Age, and that the Doctrine of Purgatory and Indulgences, are not onely not in Scripture, but alſo that there is very little, or ſcarce a jot of this uſage, nor of the mention thereof, found in the firſt times of the Chriſtian Church. It is well known, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the firſt three or four Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and ſome of the fifth it ſelf, had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Errours touching the ſtate of ſouls after death, which proceſs of time hath taken away; ſome having believed, that the ſouls did abide in a place of refreſhing near Heaven, or under Heaven, until the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Others, that they did ſleep, and that they ſhould ariſe the firſt time with their bodies to reign a thouſand years upon earth with Jeſus Chriſt;
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:37449:92"/>
and finally, at the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of the laſt Reſurrection, all that were raiſed ſhould paſs, as it were, through a Sea of Fire, which ſhould purifie and cleanſe them. But never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them did believe a place where the ſouls ſhould ſuffer, after the death of the body, pains, in ſome ſort, like thoſe of Hell, except for continuance, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> teaches. No more did the ancient Jews believe it, neither do the Greeks yet at this day believe it, though they pray for the dead after the ſame manner, as the Fathers now mentioned did.<note place="margin">

               <p>Few perſons are ignorant of the great difference that there is, betwixt the Indulgence which was formerly uſed unto publick penitents, and the pardons which Popes give, as well for the dead, as for the living; and we have ſhewed by the very confeſſion of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, that this Doctrine is not grounded upon any authority in Scripture, and that there is not found any practice nor mention of it in the five or ſix firſt Centuries.

               <p>This is what we had to ſay of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and of the Doctrines which depend upon it. It may be believed, that this may ſuffice to ſhew, that the queſtions which ſeparate us from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church upon this point, are not of ſo ſmall conſequence as the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> would inſinuate; but that on the contrary, herein is concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the pureſt, and if it may be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, the moſt Chriſtian part of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as hath been proved throughout

upon this Article; and that to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> doth not make any controverſies to ceaſe, except perhaps in regard of thoſe things which he hath ſuppreſſed, and upon this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular point of Satisfactions, upon which the Council of <hi>Trent, Bellarmine,</hi> and in a word, the doctrine and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral practice of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, formally take away what the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> would grant us.</p>

                  </note> but twelve if they will, as a Catholick Doctour did before the Council. The Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> doth in ſome ſort accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate himſelf unto this general ſenſe,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:37449:94"/>
when he uſes this expreſſion, that in his communion, <hi>there are received ſeven Signs, or ſacred Ceremonies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The difficulty is, that the Council being herein leſs equitable than the Biſhop of <hi>Condom,</hi> hath in this, as well as in the matter of Juſtification, made Articles of Faith of many particular Opinions, which are nothing to the Eſſence of Sacraments, which are good for nothing at all but for the Schools.</p>
               <p>For the Council will have us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly to believe, not only ſeven Signs or ſacred Ceremonies in a general ſenſe, but ſeven true Sacraments, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called, as it ſpeaks, and that we believe neither more nor leſs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pain of <hi>Anathema;</hi> however it is plainly to be ſeen, that at leaſt in the ceremonies of Marriage, of Pennance, and Order, which are three of theſe ſeven Sacraments, there is nothing of a viſible ſign, unto which the bleſſing can be joined, as there ought to be, to make true Sacraments, according to the Doctrine of St. <hi>Auguſtine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to their Efficacy, we agree with the Gentlemen of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:37449:95"/>
and with the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, in that we acknowledge, as they do, that the Sacraments are not onely ſignes, or ſeales of the grace of God, but inſtruments or means, which he accompanies with his power to confer that very grace.</p>
               <p>But there is this difference, which is very conſiderable, betwixt them and us, that they will have it, that <hi>the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments do confer grace, by virtue of the words which are ſpoken, and by the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is outwardly performed upon us,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 69, <hi>&amp;</hi> 70.</note> 
                  <hi>provided that we put no obſtacle by any evil diſpoſition;</hi> which is, what the Council terms conferring grace, <hi>ex opere operato</hi> (as it is alſo the language of the School) that is to ſay, by the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or by the bare celebration of the Sacrament it ſelf.</p>
               <p>And as for us, we believe in truth, that God doth accompany the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with his power, and that they confer grace, when they are received with Faith; but not that they do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it of themſelves; or by the words which are pronounced, and by the outward action done upon us, if they
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:37449:95"/>
be not received with a true Faith.</p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth believe, that this virtue is, as it were, inherent, or affixed to the Sacrament, and to the outward action which is in it perform<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed, though neither the Council, nor the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> believed themſelves bound to explain, whether it be a Moral, or Phyſical virtue; ſo that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Doctrine, this iis not neceſſary it ſelf to be in a good diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that is to ſay, to have Faith, or at leaſt, to exerciſe the acts in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Sacraments. It will ſuffice not to be in an evil diſpoſition, and thereby not to interrupt the virtue of the Sacraments, or not to put an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle thereto: for neither the Council, nor the Biſhop of <hi>Condom,</hi> require any thing elſe.</p>
               <p>But as for us, we hold unto the Word of God, which doth teach us in ſeveral places, that it is by Faith onely that we partake of theſe graces, God not affixing his power (meerly) unto viſible things,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pa.</hi> 154</note> as the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> himſelf confeſſeth in another place.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:37449:96"/>We reject the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> upon this point, with ſo much the more reaſon, for that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that it is very evil in it ſelf, there may be obſerved ſeveral conſiderable abuſes which proceed from it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, This Doctrine is very evil in it ſelf, in that it doth tye the grace of God unto outward things.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In that it carries men to neglect the acts and habits of Faith, and of other Chriſtian virtues, teaching them that the Sacraments alone regenerate and ſanctifie them, without ever trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling themſelves ſo much as to bring any good diſpoſition with them, which is a Doctrine, whereof the bare Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition doth diſguſt thoſe, who are not accuſtomed unto it.</p>
               <p>From whence alſo proceeds, that in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, they make the greateſt part of devotion and piety, to conſiſt in cauſing to be ſaid a great number of Maſſes, and of going often to confeſſion, as they ſpeak; becauſe they are taught, that the action of the Prieſt, and the words which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces, have the virtue to confer
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:37449:96"/>
grace, provided onely that they put not any obſtacle on their part.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This opinion hath ſerved to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce or eſtabliſh the Doctrine of the Real Preſence, ſuch as it is taught in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, which we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to be very bad, as we ſhall ſhew hereafter.</p>
               <p n="4">4. From thence alſo is plainly come the Opinion of the neceſſity of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Euchariſt unto Infants, which is an Errour that reigned a long time in the Church; and this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Errour of the neceſſity of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, which yet doth raign at this day in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. The ſame Opinion doth alſo give occaſion, to ſeveral other very wicked and ſuperſtitious acts, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that there have been ſome peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who have imployed the matter of the Sacraments for Charms, and for other moſt miſchievous uſes.</p>
               <p n="6">6. To conclude, the Council makes this Opinion a principle to eſtabliſh thereby many others, which we reject, and which together do corrupt very much the purity of Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:37449:97"/>So that it is evident, that this matter of the Sacraments in general, which at the firſt ſight appeared not very conſiderable, ceaſeth not nevertheleſs to be of great importance, by reaſon of the conſectaries which it drawes after it; for that this is the nature of Errour to be fruitful in productions.</p>
               <p>It were much to be deſired, that for an intire clearing of what is moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable upon this Article, the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> would have been pleaſed to have told us ſomething of his thoughts upon the ſeveral Doctrines of the Council, which he paſſeth over in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; and amongſt others, upon that of the Eleventh Canon, which requires, that the Prieſt which adminiſters the Sacrament, have an intention to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate, and to confer grace, without which there is nothing effected. It is known, that there are men to be found ſo wicked, as to ſport themſelves with the Holy Myſteries, as indeed of them there be but too many Examples. Let them tell us in this caſe, what ought to be thought of all thoſe, unto whom theſe wicked Cheates do pretend to
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:37449:97"/>
give the Sacraments of Baptiſm, and of the Euchariſt, of Pennance, and of Abſolution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As to ſome, have they not adored what was not adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? as to the others, are they not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived altogether of the effect of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, or of Abſolution, and ſo of the other Sacraments? And as to all the neceſſary conſequents of this principal Doctrine, doe they not clearly ſhew, that the Doctrine it ſelf is very evil? The Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> not ſaying any thing unto theſe controverted mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, would be content, that here, and elſewhere, where he deales after the ſame ſort, his ſilence ſhould be taken for a tacit conſent, that all theſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, howſoever eſtabliſhed by the Canons of the Council, are at leaſt of the number of thoſe things, which may be waved.</p>
               <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> reduces all the Queſtions touching Baptiſme,<note place="margin">Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</note> unto that of the neceſſity of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament for Infants, and indeed that is the chiefeſt. All that he ſays here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, conſiſts in three things, upon which it may be ſaid at firſt ſight, that this
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:37449:98"/>
haply is one of thoſe places of his Treatiſe, wherein he doth moſt of all ſwerve from his natural equity. In the firſt place, he condemnes thoſe poor ſmall creatures in terms more formal and ſevere, than the Council it ſelf doth. <hi>Infants</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>not being able to ſupply the want of Baptiſm by the acts of Faith, of Hope, and of Charity, nor by deſire or vow of receiving this Sacrament we believe that if they receive it not in,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 71, <hi>&amp;</hi> 72.</note> 
                  <hi>reality, they partake not any way of the grace of Redemption, and ſo dying in</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, <hi>they have no part in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The onely pronouncing of this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt the Infants of Believers, cauſes a kind of horrour, mingled with a tender and juſt compaſſion for theſe poor Innocents; for they are looked on as ſuch, though they are tainted with Original ſin, and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> calls them Innocents, and Martyrs, which <hi>Herod</hi> cauſed to be ſlain, and celebrates a Feaſt unto their memory. Now this very ſenſe of horrour and pity, which ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation it ſelf excites in our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, being natural and reaſonable, it is
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:37449:98"/>
a ſign there is no condemnation. You condemn them, <hi>becauſe they cannot ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the want of Baptiſm, by acts of Faith,</hi> as do the adult perſons, whom you ſave without Baptiſm: but it is for that very reaſon, that you ought not to condemn them. The <hi>Roman</hi> Church is well contented, that the Faith of Godfathers, and Godmothers, and of the Church, ſhould ſupply the want of Faith in Infants even then, when they receive Baptiſm. It is the Godfather that ſpeaking for the Child, ſaith, that he <hi>demands to be baptiſed,</hi> that he <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces the Devil,</hi> that he <hi>Believes in God;</hi> and, in a word, that makes the whole Confeſſion of Faith, which we make in the Creed. Wherefore then will ſhe not yield, that this ſame Faith of the Godfathers, and of the Church, may ſupply the place to Infants, of thoſe deſires or vows which adult perſons have for Baptiſm, or of thoſe acts of Faith, which are in ſtead of Baptiſm? There is no more reaſon for one, than for the other; if the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or Godfathers, ſpeaking for the Infant, may ſay, <hi>I believe in God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:37449:99"/>
Almighty,</hi> &amp;c. they may as well ſay for him too, <hi>I do promiſe and vow to be baptiſed, if death, or want of means do not hinder.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dying in</hi> Adam, <hi>they have no part in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> But why will you have theſe Children to dy in <hi>Adam,</hi> ſeeing they are born of Chriſtian Parents, &amp; that they dy in their arms, in the midſt of vows and prayers, which are made to God for them?<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7.</note> 
                  <hi>God is the Father of</hi> Abraham, <hi>and of his poſterity;</hi> our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Father of our Children. <hi>And the Children of Believers are holy;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14.</note> that is to ſay, they are <hi>Children of the Promiſe,</hi> as the Scripture ſpeaks; or they are born in the Covenant of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, and by conſequence, they ſhould not be excluded from the benefit of his Death, which is common to them with their Fathers, under a pretence, that they are not of age to declare, that they accept of this benefit: as in the World, the Children that are born in Cities, or in Countries, have a ſhare in the Rights and Priviledges of the Cities and Countries which they are
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:37449:99"/>
born, and in the benefits of Treaties of Peace and Friendſhip, which are made betwixt the Princes, though the Children be not in a condition of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to teſtifie, that they do ſubmit unto thoſe Treaties.</p>
               <p>You have a veneration for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks of Saints, becauſe <hi>they are parts of the living members of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> this is the reaſon which the Council gives, as it hath elſewhere been ſaid. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all, theſe are onely of the bones &amp; dead parts of thoſe living members: &amp; yet without ſcruple, you condemn theſe poor little Infants, which are as much parts of Saints, and living and anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted parts. And further, do you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that all Infants departed ſince <hi>Adam,</hi> before the inſtitution of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, or of Circumciſion, which was the Figure of Baptiſm, for example, the Children of <hi>Abel,</hi> or of <hi>Noah,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law of Nature; do you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, I ſay, that as it may be ſaid, they dyed truly in <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo that they had no part in Jeſus Chriſt? Or that God, who ſubſtituted ſome other meanes of Salvation for thoſe Infants, in the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:37449:100"/>
place of Baptiſm, or of Circumciſion, cannot and will not alſo, even yet at this day, ſupply the (neceſſitated) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault of Baptiſm, by his grace.</p>
               <p>How is it, that thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who find ſo much difficulty to comprehend the eternal Decree of God, according unto which, though we are all children of <hi>Adam,</hi> God hath choſen ſome, and paſſed by others, without, as we can conceive, any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſons, but his good pleaſure; how is it, I ſay, that theſe Gentlemen find no difficulty to believe, that the Infants of the Faithful ſhould be ſo intirely excluded from the (common) Redemption, without any other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſave that they are children of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> as the Fathers themſelves alſo were, whom God called unto Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>To conclude, what can there be more convincing againſt this abſolute neceſſity of Baptiſm, than this other neceſſity of the intention of the Prieſt, who adminiſters the Sacrament? For if on the one hand, there can be no Salvation without Baptiſm, and on
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:37449:100"/>
the other, the effect of Baptiſm depend on the intention of him who baptiſeth, not onely the Salvation of Infants, who have not been baptiſed, but the Salvation even of thoſe, who dye ſoon after Baptiſm, before they come to age, depends then abſolutely on the Prieſt: which is equally incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the Juſtice, the Power, the Wiſedom, and the Goodneſſe of God.</p>
               <p>The onely or the principal autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that the Gentlemen of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> do alledge, for the belief of a Doctrine ſo dangerous, as is this abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute neceſſity of Baptiſm, is a paſſage of our Saviours, in St. <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel, ſpeaking to <hi>Nicodemus: Except a man be born of water, and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> This paſſage is like another of our Saviours near the ſame place,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Joh.</hi> 6 53.</note> 
                  <hi>If you eat not the fleſh of the Son of man, and drink his bloud, you have no life in you;</hi> and it is true, that upon theſe two paſſages, taken according to the letter, ſome of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have grounded themſelves, as well for the neceſſity of adminiſtring
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:37449:101"/>
the Euchariſt unto Infants, as for the neceſſity of Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>But if the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath in proceſs of time juſtly acknowledged, that the neceſſity of the Euchariſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Infants, was a groſs errour, &amp; that this Sacrament ought not to be given unto Infants; wherefore is it, that ſhe doth not alſo acknowledge, that this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Baptiſm may be as much an errour? If they believe, that this laſt paſſage ought not to be underſtood of the Euchariſt, or at leaſt, that it ought not to be underſtood according to the letter, of all ſorts of perſons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently, but onely of ſuch as have age, and meanes neceſſary to partake of the Euchariſt, why do they paſs a judgment ſo contrary touching the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Why will they not alſo admit, it ought to be underſtood likewiſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, or of a ſpiritual waſhing, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the figure or expreſſion of water, and of the Spirit, which is joyned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the water? As that place which ſaith, <hi>Ye ſhall be baptized with the Holy Ghoſt, and with Fire,</hi> is alſo taken for a Spiritual Purification un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:37449:101"/>
the figure of Fire. And ſo much the rather, becauſe the occaſion it ſelf, on which Jeſus Chriſt ſpeaks thus to <hi>Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> is but indeed a particular occaſion, where there is not the leaſt appearance that our Saviour had any thoughts, neither expreſly, nor by conſequence, to eſtabliſh the neceſſity of Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing, wherein the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> here recedes from his natural equity, is this, that he would take a falſe and indirect advantage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, by what he ſaith, <hi>That the</hi> Lutherans <hi>do believe with the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>the abſolute neceſſity of Baptiſm for Infants, and that never any man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> Calvin, <hi>dared openly to call in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion this truth, it was ſo ſtrongly imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the minds of the Faithful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For, in the firſt place, the Council it ſelf doth not impoſe this neceſſity ſo abſolutely, as doth the Biſhop of <hi>Condom;</hi> it ſaith not ſo poſitively, as doth the Biſhop of <hi>Condom,</hi> that Infants have not any part in the Redemption of Jeſus Chriſt, or with Jeſus Chriſt.

               <p>We are very far from ſuffering wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly our Children to dye without Baptiſm: contrary to what he ſays, nothing is more againſt our wills; for though we do not believe, that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is neceſſary unto ſalvation by an abſolute neceſſity, (ſuch as is that of the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi>'s) no more than the participating of the Euchariſt, yet we find very great comfort in cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating the Sacraments, and ſuffer not that they be ſlighted or neglected: We do what we can poſſible to ſupply the want of ordinary Aſſemblies, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcending to them who demand this

               <p>In the mean while, behold here the uſe which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath made of this Doctrine, or the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence that ſhe hath drawn from it. <hi>We do believe,</hi> ſaith the Biſhop of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that it hath pleaſed Jeſus Chriſt, that thoſe, who have ſubmitted themſelves unto the authority of the Church by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm,

               <p>
                  <hi>We believe that it hath pleaſed Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. but upon what ground?

               <p>In the firſt place, is it not a ſtrange thing, that the Council doth oblige all to believe, as an article of Faith, under pain of Excommunication, and Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, that Confeſſion, Abſolution, and Satisfaction, as they ſpeak, are not onely a neceſſary means of Salvation, or a ſign and ſacred Ceremony, as the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> terms it, but <hi>a true Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament properly ſo called,</hi> as are Baptiſm and the Euchariſt; though it is plain, that there is nothing properly here, <hi>whereby the bleſſing of the Word might be joyned unto ſome viſible ſign,</hi> which ſerves as matter, according to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of St. <hi>Auſtin.</hi>

                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:37449:108"/>2. Is it not alſo an odd thing, that the Council doth make articles of Faith of all theſe diſtinctions, of Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Contrition, and ſeveral others, which at leaſt ought to be left to the Schools? and that becauſe a certain Father ſpeaking of Repentance after ſin,<note n="*" place="margin">St. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom.</hi>
                  </note> compares it unto a Plank, by which a man ſaves himſelf, when the Veſſel is caſt away,<note place="margin">Seſſ. <hi>14.</hi> de Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cram. Paenit. Can. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> the Council applying this compariſon unto the Sacrament of Pennance, and of Confeſſion, which nevertheleſs is quite another thing, as hath been ſhewed, thunders out an <hi>Anathema</hi> againſt all ſuch who do not agree, <hi>that Pennance is rightly called a ſecond Plank after Shipwrack;</hi> as it were, canoniſing a Figure of Rhetorick. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it may be ſaid, that the Council intended onely to define the thing it ſelf: but let them ſay herein what they will, it doth not at all ſuit with the ſimplicity and gravity of the Subject, nor with the honour and gravity of the Council it ſelf, and it cannot be, but that this eaſineſs in making arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Faith of all things, &amp; throwing out <hi>Anathema's</hi> on all hands, muſt create
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:37449:108"/>
offence in ſome, and contempt in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>To conclude, if it be true, as the Council it ſelf hath once defined it, touching all the Sacraments in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and here in particular touching this of Pennance, that when the Prieſt hath no real intention to abſolve the ſinner, or when he doth not make uſe of <hi>this Form</hi> of Abſolution, <hi>Ego te ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvo, &amp;c.</hi> I abſolve thee, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> which is the <hi>eſsential and neceſsary Form of this Sacrament,</hi> in which principally conſiſts all its virtue, according to the ſame Council, or where the Prieſt hath not power to abſolve, as in caſes reſerved unto the Biſhop, or unto the Pope himſelf, in all theſe caſes, Confeſſion is without any effect, and the ſinner without pardon: of what nature then is this Doctrine, or Religion, which runs all along upon ſo uncertain principles, which makes the grace of God, and the ſalvation of men, to depend ſtill upon the villany giddineſs, errour or want of power of one man?</p>
               <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> hath almoſt throughout uſed an eaſie expedient to
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:37449:109"/>
diſentangle himſelf; for either he ſaith nothing of all theſe Doctrines of the Council, or he doth not engage him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to prove any thing, of what he himſelf ſpeaks to them, if it be not ſometimes, when he thinks that the matter is favourable for him, or that he may inlarge himſelf without the leaſt danger.</p>
               <p>Here he wraps himſelf up in two opinions, which are little to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, keeping a profound ſilence upon all the reſt: The Firſt is, <hi>that the terms of the Commiſſion which is given to the Miniſters of the Church to remit ſins, are ſo general, that they cannot without te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merity, be reſtrained unto publick ſins, &amp;c.</hi> This is a little obſcure, the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> ſeems to intimate that amongſt us, we do believe that the Miniſters of the Church cannot give abſolution, but onely of publick ſins, becauſe that amongſt us, there is none but ſinners who have committed notorious ſins, that make a publick acknowledgment in the preſence of the Aſſembly; unto whom, in this caſe, the Miniſters an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the pardon of their ſins, with
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:37449:109"/>
the circumſtances and co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tidions, which, according to cuſtome, relate thereto.</p>
               <p>But yet for all that, it is not true, that we limit the power of announ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing pardon of ſins unto publick ſins: and becauſe we have no better mean, whether it be to refute the Doctrines of thoſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, or to make them in love with our Doctrine, than to make them rightly underſtand it, it ſhall be explained here in a few words, what is the practice of our Churches, touching confeſſion, and remiſſion of ſins.</p>
               <p>There are ſeveral occaſions, upon which we do confeſs our ſins, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be in publick or private, and wherein our Paſtours doe announce unto us forgiveneſs. Firſt, in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Aſſemblies, in our entrance upon our ordinary exerciſes, we make unto God a general confeſſion of our ſins: Every one makes a particular reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon his own ſins, and upon them whereunto he finds himſelf moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the Sermon, we are again ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:37449:110"/>
to confeſs our ſins heartily, to repent of them, to be a better people, on which condition God pardons us; it is the main ſubject, and perpetual concluſion of all our Sermons.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In our Houſes, in our Cloſets, we do again more particularly confeſs our ſins in the preſence of God; and both on the one and the other of theſe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, we believe, that if we are truly penitent, with a true and lively confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the ſufferings of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and a ſtedfaſt reſolution to live better for the time to come, God vouchſafes us the grace of pardon, and regeneration.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Upon the particular occaſions of communion in the Sacraments of Baptiſm, and of the Euchariſt, in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, and upon the ſolemn occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Faſting, we do make a more expreſs, and as we may ſo ſpeak, ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated confeſſion of our ſins, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be in publick prayers, or in our own private reflexions: and on theſe occaſions again the Miniſters, in the name and in the authority of Jeſus Chriſt, in the very Quality of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:37449:110"/>
declare on the one hand, the Judgments of God upon the impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; and on the other, ſuppoſing the Faith and repentance of the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, they announce unto us the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of our ſins.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In our ſickneſſes, and eſpecially in thoſe that are moſt dangerous, we likewiſe more particularly confeſs our ſins, whether it be before our Paſtours and Guides, or before our Friends; making alſo acknowledgment ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more particularly and freely, of the infirmities and ſins whereunto we are moſt ſubject. Our Friends and our Paſtours exhort us unto a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſorrow for our faults, and unto an intire truſt in our Saviour; and our Paſtours in particular do exhort and comfort us. If they ſee us in too great ſecurity, or too little touched with the ſenſe of our ſins, they declare unto us the ſeverity of Gods Judgments againſt impenitent Sinners: as on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, if they behold in us true motions of ſorrow and repentance, and a lively hope in the death of our Saviour, they aſſure us, that God will ſhew grace
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:37449:111"/>
and mercy to us. If we have any quarrel or animoſities, whether it be in ſickneſs or health, they ſay to us, as St. <hi>James, Confeſs your faults one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other;</hi> for this is the true meaning of that paſſage, and not the Sacramental confeſſion, as the ſincere<note n="*" place="margin">Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal Aureo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus in Compen. elucid. <hi>5.</hi> upon this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of Saint <hi>James.</hi> Hu.

                  </note> Doctours of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church do agree. They exhort us unto reconciliation, &amp; they in effect reconcile us. They exhort us generally to reſtore the Goods we do unjuſtly retain, and thoſe who are honeſt and ſufficient, do thereupon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally reſtore them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Even in health it ſelf, we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to have recourſe to the whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome advice and conſolations of our Paſtours and Guides, and thoſe under their charge, who are afflicted with any conſiderable perplexity, whether as to Faith, or as to any great ſinnes whereunto they find themſelves incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, are to have recourſe unto them, and ſo really have.</p>

life. In this manner is it, that the power, which Jeſus Chriſt hath given unto his Miniſters, is exerciſed amongſt us; which is, what we call the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of our Churches: thus far is it, tht we extend it in this regard; and not any farther, to ſet up a Tribunal for our Guides, wherein they ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe an abſolute dominion over the conſciences of men.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who are but the leaſt verſed in Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, may eaſily ſee, if this be not as meerly as can be, the ancient uſage of the Church, whether for ordinary Sinners, or publick Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, except it be, that the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the times hath cauſed but too great a relaxation of the rigour of this Diſcipline; which thing is the cauſe, that the cenſures and puniſhments are nothing near ſo grievous, and ſo long as they were, and as there was a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity they ſhould be, at the firſt eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing of Chriſtianity, for the better perſwading the people of the Holineſs of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt. In which behalf, the Gentlemen of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church are ſo far from having
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:37449:113"/>
any thing to reproach us of, that they very well know they have not any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of this publick pennance of the Ancients, as hath been ſhewed we have; for they have changed all into this other kind of Pennance, or into this private confeſſion to the Prieſt, even of ſins which are moſt notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and which give moſt ſcandal.</p>
               <p>But <hi>this private confeſſion,</hi> adds the Biſhop of <hi>Condom, is ſo neceſſary a curb of licentiouſneſs, ſo fruitful a ſpring of wiſe Counſels, ſo ſenſible a conſolation of troubled ſouls, when Abſolution is not onely declared unto them in general terms, as the Miniſters practice, but that they are effectually abſolved, by the authority of Jeſus Chriſt, after a particular exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and with cogniſance of the cauſe, that we cannot believe that our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries can behold the ſo great benefits here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, without regret for the loſs of them, and without ſome ſhame of a Reformation, that hath taken away a practice ſo whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and holy.</hi> This is the ſecond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt, in which it was ſaid, that the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> had wrapt up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>
                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:37449:114"/>In the firſt place, it was juſt now ſhewed, that it is not true, that we have taken away this practice, nor loſt the benefits and fruites of the Counſels, and comforts which may be thence expected; we have taken away the Evil, which is almoſt alwayes in the abuſe and exceſs of the beſt things: wherefore, God be praiſed, we have no cauſe of regret nor ſhame, in this regard.</p>
               <p>If the Prieſt or the Miniſter were our abſolute Judge, if it were ſo with him, that he had truly the right or power to condemn, or to abſolve us, it were to be acknowledged in this caſe we ought to render him an exact account of all the circumſtances of our lives: but it is God alone, who is the true Judge, who knowes our hearts, and our moſt ſecret thoughts, even when we ſay nothing unto him of them.</p>
               <p>And as to what concerns the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits and fruits of Confeſſion, which the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> thought fit onely to touch in general terms, as we are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, &amp; as there are but few Doctrines ſo bad, that have not ſome good in

them in ſome regard, we ingenuouſly acknowledge, that private confeſſion of ſins may ſometimes produce ſome good effects, either to cauſe reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be made of what is unjuſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, or to beget a greater ſhame in ſinners for their miſcarriages and ſins: therefore alſo it hath been ſhewed, that we are very far from condemning or rejecting all ſorts of Confeſſions. We onely ſay that we cannot ſuſtain, with good conſcience, this Tribunal, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, this Yoke, which is impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conſcience it ſelf; this Article of Faith, and this abſolute neceſſity, to tell all a mans ſins by particulars, without which the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is ſo bold as to teach, that the Faithful cannot obtain pardon of their ſins, whatever bitter ſorrow they feel for them, and whatever firm belief they have in the death of our Saviour: for even this alſo the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> teacheth.<note place="margin">Seſſ. <hi>14</hi> de Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cram Paeni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In ſumme, in exchange of what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits may accrue by the Sacramental Confeſſion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, we call to witneſs the ſincere perſons of
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:37449:115"/>
her communion, if it be not true, that this Confeſſion is alſo the original of infinite Evils. If any ſhall not be pleaſed to agree hereunto, we have the experience of all times on this matter, and the teſtimony of their<note n="*" place="margin">Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand.

               <p>In plain truth, inſtead of being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a curb unto licentiouſneſs, men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtome themſelves to ſin, upon the confidence they have, that their ſins ſhall be blotted out by this ordinary and eaſie way of Confeſſion, or by ſome corporal or pecuniary pennan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces impoſed upon them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alſo it hath often been obſerved in our Churches, that the leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular perſons are moſt ſubject to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake our Communion, becauſe that whileſt they continue in their ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, they find nothing that may aſſure them of the pardon and abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which they hope for of a Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor.
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:37449:115"/>
And if it be true, that the Confeſſors, or Directors of conſcience, as they are termed, often give wiſe counſels, it is but too true alſo, that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors themſelves very often take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion thereby to corrupt themſelves, or to inſinuate themſelves in all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick affairs of State, or in the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar affairs of private Families: and Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory is but too full of the Evils, which have hapned unto the publick, and to particular perſons. The very conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on alſo which they give Sinners in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing their abſolution, doth turn into ſecurity; and to conclude, as hath already been openly declared upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſubject, it cannot be made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that they, who live in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of auricular Confeſſion, are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter people, than thoſe who confeſs themſelves chiefly unto God.</p>
               <p>The Council here joines Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme Unction unto Repentance.<note place="margin">Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction.</note>
               </p>
               <p>There is this difference betwixt the precedent Article, and this, that this latter is nothing near of ſo great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. This is nothing in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but an uſeleſs ceremony, and an
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:37449:116"/>
evil cuſtom, whereof the errour may be tolerable in it ſelf, if it were not of dangerous influence in introducing into Religion leſſer matters, which might by little and little turn away the ſoul and heart from ſolid piety. We might upon better grounds, call this ceremony a Sacrament, than Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, Marriage, or Orders, which follow this, becauſe at leaſt, the Oyl may there hold the place of a viſible Sign, as the Council, and the Biſhop of <hi>Condom,</hi> doe not fail to give to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand.</p>
               <p>But, after all, this pretended Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath this common with pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and the others, which we admit not as Sacraments, that the Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, is onely founded upon ſome cuſtom practiſed on particular occaſions, which are now ceaſed.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>James</hi> ſpeaking of the virtue of Prayer, ſaith (and that onely once) in concluding his Epiſtle, <hi>Is any ſick a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you? let him call for the Elders of the Church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with Oyl in the name of
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:37449:116"/>
the Lord: And the Prayer of Faith ſhall ſave the Sick, and the Lord ſhall raiſe him up; and if he hath committed ſins, they ſhall be forgiven him.</hi> The <hi>Roman</hi> Catechiſm cannot deny, but that theſe words have alluſion unto what was ſaid before of the Apoſtles, who being departed from our Saviour, <hi>preached that men ſhould repent,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">S. <hi>Mark cap.</hi> 6.12, 13.</note>

                  </note> ſuch as is related in the Goſpel, and not of the Extreme Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which is practiſed in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; In the mean time, this is all the Foundation, or all the pretext which the Council, and the Biſhop of
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:37449:117"/>
                  <hi>Condom</hi> have, for the inſtituting of ſuch a Sacrament.</p>
               <p>What is worſt of all is, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth not doe the thing it ſelf, according to the words, and the intention of St. <hi>James.</hi> St. <hi>James</hi> teſtifies, that it was to heal the Sick; and, which is very remarkable, the other words of the Evangeliſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which theſe of St. <hi>James</hi> allude (as the <hi>Roman</hi> Catechiſme doth agree) ſpeak onely indeed of healing the Sick; unto which it is true that St. <hi>James</hi> adds, <hi>that if the Sick hath committed ſins, they ſhall be forgiven him,</hi> which is principally to be underſtood of thoſe ſins, that may have drawn the chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſickneſs upon the ſick perſon. The <hi>Roman</hi> Church doth on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, make Extreme Unction to be a Sacrament of Remiſſion of ſins, as Baptiſm; and regards little or nothing the health of the body, acknowledging that it hath not now the miraculous gift of healing the ſick. Therefore alſo it is, that, whereas St. <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks of the ſick in general, in what eſtate ſoever they be, the Church of
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:37449:117"/>
                  <hi>Rome</hi> doth for the moſt part under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that they muſt be at the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, before this Unction be carried unto them; and ſhe never gives it unto little children. This is as much as to ſay, that in all things, even of the leaſt moment, ſhe muſt invent or add ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of her own, if it were but onely to ſhew her authority.</p>
               <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> ſpeaks onely one word here of Marriage, and he ſaith nothing but what we would ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eaſily conſent unto. We acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as he doth, that Marriage is one of the moſt ſacred Bands of civil Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety: but we do not agree with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that Marriage is a true Sacrament, nor that it ſhould not be permitted unto them that are in Orders, as they ſpeak, to marry; as if there ought to be a kind of incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibility betwixt two divers Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Goſpel: neither, Laſtly, do we agree unto many other maxime of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> touching Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, whereof we do not find any track in Scripture, nor in the practice of the ancient Church. But ſeeing
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:37449:118"/>
the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> enters not upon theſe Queſtions, we will forbear ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them here.</p>
               <p>We will onely obſerve, that the Council could not better ſet forth the reaſons, that it had to make ſo many Decrees, and ſo many Canons touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Marriage, which is nevertheleſs naturally a civil contract, than by the firſt and the laſt of theſe ſame Canons, which comprehend all the reſt. The firſt doth pronounce <hi>Anathema againſt all thoſe, who do not believe that Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age is a true Sacrament;</hi> and the laſt, <hi>againſt all thoſe, who will not believe that all cauſes concerning Marriage, do belong to the Church:</hi> that is to ſay, that theſe two Canons were made the one for the other. Every one at the firſt ſight may ſee, the great conſequences of this Doctrine, and the great advantages which do ariſe unto the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> whether it be for the authority in examination of Matrimonial cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, or for the income of Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. It was neceſſary that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> might take cogniſance of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Matrimonial, for the great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:37449:118"/>
which accrue unto her thereby: and to bring it to paſs, that ſhe might have cognizance of them, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to make Marriage a Sacrament; as alſo ſhe would have had cognizance of all other civil affairs, under pretext of the Oath which was inſerted in contracts, if the juſt jealouſie of the Parliaments of our Kings, had not ſet ſome bounds to the enterpriſes of the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for Order or Orders, (for the Council ſets down Seven under this name, to wit, the Prieſt, the Deacon,<note place="margin">Order.</note> the Subdeacon, the Acolyte, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orciſt, the Reader, and the Porter,) The Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> ſpeaks onely a word of Order in general, as he hath done of Marriage, to put it into the number of Sacraments. It is true, as he ſaith, that we hold the miniſtry of the Word of God for a ſacred thing, taking the term in a general ſenſe. We practiſe the ceremony of Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Hands, as it was practiſed in the Apoſtles time; but we cannot agree, that Order or Orders are a true Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as Baptiſm, and the Euchariſt:
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:37449:119"/>
as well for that in Orders, there is no Element, or Viſible ſign, no more than in Marriage, and in confeſſion; as alſo becauſe it is in truth the nature of the Sacraments of the Goſpel, that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments ought to be common to all the Church, and Orders are not.</p>
               <p>It is in this point alſo the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of <hi>Rome,</hi> that made Orders a true Sacrament; to the end ſhe might withdraw all the great Body of the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy, from the Juriſdiction of the civil Magiſtrate, and thereby make unto her ſelf proper ſubjects of other Princes people, in the midſt of their States and Kingdoms, as a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Kingdom, or Hierarchy apart, not only diſtinct from the Temporal Monarchy, but ſuperiour, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling Kings themſelves.</p>
               <p>Many things might be ſaid upon this Article, to ſhew principally, that the Prieſthood and the ſacrificing of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, is an invention purely humane; and that it hath no example, nor any foundation in the Goſpel: for there can be no true Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:37449:119"/>
where there is not a true Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; and in the following Diſcourſe it ſhall be made appear, that there is none ſuch in the Maſs. But in this place we will be content to follow the Biſhop of <hi>Condom,</hi> who had no mind to engage in all theſe Queſtions; whether it be that he deſerts them ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely by his ſilence, or that he thought them to be fitter for the Schools, than for publick edification; or Laſtly, that he haſtened to paſs unto the matter of the Euchariſt, where he believed he might inlarge himſelf with leſs diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>

We will touch each of theſe Heads, with as much brevity as ſhall be poſſible.</p>
               <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> begins with this propoſition, that <hi>the Real Preſence is firmly eſtabliſhed by theſe words of the inſtitution of the Euchariſt, THIS IS MY BODY.</hi> The reaſon, which he gives thereof, is, becauſe <hi>the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>doth underſtand them according to the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi> and here it is that he ſaith, what hath been alledged elſewhere upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſubject, that <hi>you muſt no more ask them, wherefore they apply themſelves to
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:37449:121"/>
the literal ſenſe, than of a Traveller, why he follows the High way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let any one judge of the ſequel, by the beginning. The Queſtion betwixt us is, Whether the Bread and the Wine in the Sacrament, are truly and really the Body and Bloud of Jeſus Chriſt; or whether they are ſo onely in the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery: That is to ſay, whether the words of the inſtitution, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> ought to be underſtood literally, or figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively; whether they truly ſignifie a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al preſence, as they ſpeak, or a preſence myſtical, and of virtue, for it is all one and the ſame thing. The Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> ſaith, without any other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, that the belief of the real pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, is firmly eſtabliſhed upon theſe words, becauſe the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth underſtand them according to the letter; that is, it is ſo, becauſe I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it ſo; that is to ſay, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides the queſtion, by the thing it ſelf, which is in queſtion; or that he doth give us his ſenſe, &amp; his will for a reaſon. To have the liberty to ſpeak as the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> doth, we muſt lay it as a principle, that there is nothing in
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:37449:121"/>
the Scripture that one ſhould not, or at leaſt, that may not be taken literally. Then might ſhe take literally, what our Saviour ſaith elſewhere,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>John</hi> 6.35. <hi>&amp;</hi> 19.5.</note> that he is <hi>the bread of Heaven;</hi> or that he <hi>is a vine, and his Diſciples are the branches,</hi> and that none ſhould be allowed to inquire how it might be.</p>
               <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> judging tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough, that this was not a propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition maintainable, enters upon two other conceipts more reaſonable; On the one ſide, he ingageth us to prove, that the words of inſtitution of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, ought to be taken in a Figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſenſe: On the other, he engages to prove himſelf,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pa.</hi> 80</note> that they ought to be taken according to the letter. <hi>It is their part,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>who have recourſe to Figurative ſenſes, to give a reaſon of what they do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We will therefore here ſet down ſome of the reaſons, which we have for the Figurative ſenſe, ſeeing that the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> doth require it of us; and afterwards we will examine thoſe, which the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> doth alledge for the proper and literal ſenſe.</p>

               <p>But if it be demanded more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, wherefore the Bread and the Wine are ſaid to be the Body &amp; Bloud of Jeſus Chriſt, St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret,</hi>

               <p n="2">2. We know in general, that all the Scripture of the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is full of theſe ſorts of Figurative expreſſions: whether it was the Style of the Eaſtern Nations in thoſe times, as indeed it was; or that God judged this Style the fitteſt to exerciſe our Faith. We ſee, that the Firſt preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Jeſus Chriſt is nothing elſe, but a continued ſucceſſion of Figures:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>John</hi> 6.35. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.3.</note> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one knows thoſe juſt now mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <hi>I am the bread which came down from Heaven. I am the vine. The rock

                  <hi>If thine eye offend thee, pluck it out,</hi> and an infinite number of others. Now if it be demanded of us, how we can diſtinguiſh betwixt Figurative expreſſions, and thoſe which are proper and literal, St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> here again anſwers for us, <hi>that what ſeemes to offend good manners, or the truth of Faith, ought to be taken in a Figurative ſenſe;</hi> and yet more expreſly, <hi>that this, which Jeſus Chriſt ſaith, that we muſt eat his body, and drink his bloud, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing a wicked thing, is therefore a Figure.</hi> We preſs not ſtill this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage as to the main Queſtion, we onely alledge it, to make the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which we have for the Figurative ſenſe, better apprehended.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Finally, what can there be more natural, and more reaſonable, than to underſtand the Scripture by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture it ſelf, the obſcure places by them which are more plain, thoſe which have a double meaning, by them which have but a ſingle? The Authour of the Book, intituled, <hi>Lawful Prejudices,</hi> layes down this Maxim for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of Books, that when there
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:37449:123"/>
is any paſſage, which may admit of a double ſenſe, that muſt be taken, which agrees beſt with the whole, and which is the moſt reaſonable. There is but one paſſage onely in the Scripture, which ſeems to favour the literal ſenſe, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> gives to theſe words, <hi>This is my Body;</hi> to wit, that which we now ſpoke of, <hi>If you eat not the fleſh, and drink the bloud of the Son of man, you have no life in you;</hi> and this very expreſſion St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> notes, ought to be underſtood Figuratively: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as there are a great number of others, which ſay, that Jeſus Chriſt is no more with us, but by the operation of the Holy Spirit. <hi>The poor you ſhall have always with you,</hi>

                  <hi>but me ye ſhall not have always. And, if I depart, I will ſend the Comforter unto you;</hi> and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more,<note place="margin">

<pb n="230" facs="tcp:37449:124"/>
ſenſes repugnant: but not to be any more with us, or to be corporally in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and yet to be every day upon Earth, in mens hands in his proper Body, are two terms contradictory and incompatible. It is therefore na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to take theſe words, <hi>This is my body,</hi> in a myſtical and Figurative ſenſe, which alone doth perfectly agree with all the other paſſages of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
               <p>It is well known, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth ſuppoſe, that there be two divers ways, according unto which ſhe pretends, that the Body of Jeſus Chriſt may be preſent in Heaven and upon Earth; the one with his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions, and his exteriour qualities, ſuch as he was ſeen upon Earth; and it is after this manner that ſhe will have it to be ſaid, that Jeſus Chriſt is no more with us, or that he is onely in Heaven: the other without his dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and exteriour qualities, as ſhe pretends that he is under the covert of Bread and Wine. But this is to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer here punctually the thing in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. We formally deny this ſecond
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:37449:124"/>
manner of being bodily in a place; &amp; it is not conteſted, but that nature, the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, &amp; reaſon, far from teaching any ſuch thing, cry loudly againſt it. It would therefore highly concern the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> upon the whole caſe, to eſtabliſh this ſecond manner of being in a place by ſome paſſage, the ſenſe whereof were not at all in queſtion; and till that is done, it may be truly ſaid, that the figurative ſenſe of theſe words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> is the true and genuine ſenſe, the firſt, and the onely that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents it ſelf unto the mind.</p>
               <p>We might here add many other reaſons, as to the main, to make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that the Doctrine of the real pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, is not onely above reaſon, as the Myſteries of the Trinity, and Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, but directly againſt reaſon, and which in fine, deſtroyes the teſtimony of the ſenſes; which nevertheleſs is it, that our Lord made uſe of,<note place="margin">

too far in the queſtion. What hath been here ſaid, which is onely ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the nature of Sacraments, &amp; the ſtyle of the Scripture, may ſuffice to ſhew the Biſhop of <hi>Condom,</hi> that it is not without reaſon, that we do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand theſe words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> in a myſtical and figurative ſenſe; let us now ſee what he will produce on his part, for the proper and literal ſenſe.</p>
               <p>His diſcourſe doth reduce it ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two propoſitions: the firſt is, <hi>That it is the intention of Jeſus Chriſt, that we ſhould effectively eat his fleſh;</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that <hi>there is no natural relation betwixt bread, and the body of Jeſus Chriſt; and that our Saviour having one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid theſe words,</hi> This is my Body, <hi>without explaining them, as he did ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily other figurative expreſſions, the law of diſcourſe,</hi> as the Biſhop of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>doth not permit that they ſhould be taken otherwiſe, than in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and literal ſenſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the firſt, touching our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours intention, it is a good principle, provided it be well eſtabliſhed, for Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:37449:126"/>
Chriſt can do what he will, &amp; what he wills, is done as he wills; and the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> hath no need to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large upon the power of God, as he doth in what follows; nor to ſeek for reaſons, why Jeſus Chriſt would not give us his fleſh in its very Form, but under the covert of Bread, that ſo we might not conceive an horrour at the eating it. Theſe are the common pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the firſt inventors of this Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and of all thoſe who have follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, and yet nevertheleſs, all this hath nothing of ſolidity: becauſe on the one hand, we concern not our ſelves to examine, whether God is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to do the thing, but whether this thing is poſſible in it ſelf, or if it doth not imply a contradiction: and on the other, if it be matter of horrour to eat true humane fleſh, the covert may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh this horrour, but it cannot quite take it away, eſpecially if a man were certainly perſwaded, that he did truly eat humane fleſh, and beſides that, ſuch fleſh, for the which he ſhould have a tender veneration.</p>
               <p>But to conclude, how is it that the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:37449:127"/>
Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> proves, that this is the intention of Jeſus Chriſt, that we ſhould effectively eat his fleſh? <hi>As the Jewes did eat the victims which were offered for them,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 81, 82, 83, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>ſo,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt our true ſacrifice, would that we ſhould effectively eat his fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Jewes were forbidden to eat the ſacrifice offered for ſins, to ſhew them, that the true expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation was not made under the Law; and for the ſame reaſon they were forbidden to eat bloud, becauſe the bloud was given for the atonement of ſouls: but by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary reaſon, Jeſus Chriſt wills that we ſhould eat his fleſh, to ſhew, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins is accompliſhed in the New Teſtament, and that we ſhould drink his bloud, becauſe it is poured out for our ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus it is, that inſtead of giving us reaſons, the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> gives us onely compariſons, relations, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances: as if it were not a known rule, that compariſons and examples may ſerve well to illuſtrate things already proved, but can never prove the things which are in queſtion. It is true, that the ſacrifices of the old Law, were the
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:37449:127"/>
figure of the ſacrifice, which our Lord Jeſus Chriſt offered upon the Croſs: that is to ſay, that as they offered up ſacrifices, which were types of Jeſus Chriſt our true ſacrifice, to appeaſe the wrath of God, Jeſus Chriſt offered up himſelf to reconcile us unto his Father. This is the true accompliſhment of the figures of the Law, and the principal and true relation, which there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the ſacrifices of the Old &amp; New Teſtaments: therefore alſo it is, that our Saviour giving up the Ghoſt, ſaid theſe laſt and great words,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.30.</note> 
                  <hi>It is finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> The Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> which makes a parallel between the ſacrifices of the Law, and of Jeſus Chriſt, inſiſts onely on this point; that under the Law, the ſacrifices were to be reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted every day, whereas Jeſus Chriſt offered himſelf onely once, and we ſee not, that the Holy Scriptures purſue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny farther myſtery in it. To preſs fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe ſorts of relations and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, to make new doctrines, and to bring all that is ſaid of the ſacrifices of the Old Teſtament, to be ſaid or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, of the ſacrifice of the New, this
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:37449:128"/>
would be to make Articles of Faith, &amp; Worſhips, upon conſequences where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in humane reaſon would have too much ſhare.</p>
               <p>But nevertheleſs if they will have it ſo, that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there ſhould be a relation betwixt all the circumſtances of the ſacrifices of the Old Teſtament, and the Euchariſt, which is the repreſentation of the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, that he himſelf offered upon the Croſs, we are ſo far from thinking, that all the relations and all the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, which are to be found betwixt the one and the other, ſhould be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood according to the letter that we know, the intention of the Goſpel is oppoſed to the letter of the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> that whereas the <hi>Jewes</hi> under the Law, did ſervilely and carnally ty themſelves, to outward and material actions, it concerns Chriſtians under the Goſpel, to take all ſpiritually, and lift up their ſouls &amp; hearts unto Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;<note place="margin">

This is true, we lay hold on Jeſus Chriſt by Faith, we eat him by Faith, according to the ſpeech of St. <hi>Auſtin, Believe, and thou haſt eaten.</hi> The <hi>Jewes</hi> did not eat the ſin-offering, nor did they ever eat of the bloud; we eat the myſtical body of our ſacrifice, and we drink his my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical bloud: and as the expiation of our ſins is actually made by his death upon the Croſs, ſo our Saviour ſets be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes the ſacred Symbols of his dead body, as ſeals of his grace, and of the remiſſion of our ſins.</p>
               <p>See here how we might enlarge for our edification, the relations and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, which we may find in this caſe, betwixt the Old and New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament; betwixt the ſacrifices of the Law, and the divine ſacrifice of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Theſe conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are right, pious, and conform to the ſpirit of the Goſpel: but as to the main, that which is called a Doctrine and a Worſhip, and an Article of Faith, as is the eating of the proper fleſh and bloud of Jeſus Chriſt, ſhould not be
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:37449:129"/>
founded upon relations and agreean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but upon a clear and poſitive re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.</p>

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 84.</note>But <hi>this eating,</hi> ſaith the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> here, <hi>ought to be as real, as the expiation of ſins is actual and effective, under the new Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the firſt place, it muſt be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved here, that the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> doth perpetually miſtake himſelf upon the term of <hi>Real,</hi> in the queſtion of the Euchariſt: he alwayes ſuppoſes, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and corporal, are but one and the ſame thing, and that a thing is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, if it be not corporal. The eating or partaking of the body of Jeſus Chriſt, is very real according to us, &amp; as real and effective, as the expiation of our ſins: but it doth not follow for all that, that there is a neceſſity that this participation be corporal, that is to ſay, that we muſt receive the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per fleſh, and the proper bloud of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, with the mouth of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; according as in Baptiſm we doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, both the Gentlemen of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church and we, that we do par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of, or that we are truly and really
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:37449:129"/>
united unto Jeſus Chriſt, and unto his ſacrifice, and yet for all that, this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not corporal.</p>
               <p>In fine, there is a kind of incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibility, or of contradiction, in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Condom</hi>'s arguing. He would have it, that as the <hi>Jewes</hi> did effective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eat of the ſacrifice offered for their ſins, we alſo ſhould effectively eat the body of Jeſus Chriſt our ſacrifice; and he doth not conſider, that as the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices which the <hi>Jewes</hi> did eat were dead, ſo it would be neceſſary that the body of Jeſus Chriſt in the Sacrament, were in a ſtate of death, that it might be eaten as a ſacrifice: whereas the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> teacheth, that he is there in a ſtate of life, that is to ſay, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and not dead.</p>
               <p>As to what is the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi>'s other propoſition, that there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation betwixt the bread and the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Jeſus Chriſt, is it not openly to gainſay, what hath been already alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and <hi>Theodoret? that the Sacraments doe not take the name of the things whereof they are Sacraments, but becauſe of the relation which there is
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:37449:130"/>
betwixt the Sacraments, and the things themſelves: that without this relation, they could not be Sacraments; that it is formally becauſe of this relation, that the bread and the wine are called the body &amp; the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt</hi> (for theſe are St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s own words) and that to conclude,<note place="margin">Epiſt. <hi>23</hi> ad Bonif.</note> 
                  <hi>As Jeſus Chriſt had ſaid, that he was bread, and a vine, he ſaid after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that the bread was his body, and the wine his bloud, giving, as it were, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocally, the names of the one, unto the other,</hi>

So that we may plainly ſee,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:37449:131"/>
ſo far is it from there being no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation betwixt bread, and the body of Jeſus Chriſt, as the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> ſuppoſeth, that we find on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary the two relations, which he calls natural relation; and relation of inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and of which he demands but one, or the other, that the ſign may take the name of the thing, and that it might be proper to bring down the Idea into the mind: to wit, a relation of the natural virtue of bread, unto that of the body of Jeſus Chriſt, the body of Jeſus Chriſt being the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment of our ſouls, as bread is the nouriſhment of our bodies; and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation which Jeſus Chriſt had eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before in the minds of his Apoſtles,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jo.</hi> 6.52</note> by the uſe which he had made of this likeneſs, having accuſtomed them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this manner of ſpeaking, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the inſtitution of the Sacraments, and confirming or eſtabliſhing anew this relation, by the very words of the inſtitution it ſelf.</p>
               <p>But there is here yet ſomething elſe to be underſtood: The Biſhop of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> doth curteil, if I may ſo ſay, the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:37449:131"/>
words of inſtitution, or rather the ſenſe; and ſecretly makes a kind of Sophiſme in dividing the words, and examining them in a ſenſe ſeparate the one from another, inſtead of taking them altogether. Here it concerned not to enquire the relation there is, betwixt bread and the body of Jeſus Chriſt barely; this relation conſiſts, as it was ſaid, in that the one doth nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh our bodies, and the other doth nouriſh our ſouls. The likeneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>the bread broken,</hi> and the <hi>body broken,</hi> ſhould have been ſearched into: for Jeſus Chriſt gives us not his body properly, but in this regard; and Jeſus Chriſt ſayes not onely, <hi>this is my body,</hi> he ſaith in the ſame breath, <hi>my body which is broken for you.</hi> And ſuppoſe that theſe firſt words had not clearly enough intimated the relation, which there is betwixt the bread and the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Jeſus Chriſt, theſe others which our Saviour adds, are as a ſecond touch of a pencil, or a new colour, which heighthens the draught, and better expreſſes the reſemblance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Image, and the Divine O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal:
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:37449:132"/>
that is to ſay, that as the bread is broken in pieces to ſerve us for nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, and as the wine is poured out to ſerve us for drink, ſo the body of Jeſus Chriſt was broken, and his bloud was ſhed upon the Croſs, to be the ſpiritual nouriſhment of our ſouls.</p>
               <p>Here we muſt obſerve the perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al errour, or the continual ſource of the errour of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church upon this point. The <hi>Roman</hi> Church makes the Eſſential, the Principal, the force, and virtue of the inſtitution of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, to conſiſt in theſe firſt words, <hi>This is my body,</hi> which are the onely ones ſhe is wont to call Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental. It is by virtue of theſe words alone, that the conſecration is made; one would think, that the others ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie nothing, or that they be nothing in compariſon of the former, whereas if we rightly take the thing, according to the end, which it is plain, our Lord propoſed to himſelf in this Inſtitution, theſe firſt words are onely the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, the vehicle, or the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all that follows; as in arguing, the firſt propoſitions are onely a lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:37449:132"/>
unto the concluſion, and are far leſs conſiderable than the concluſion it ſelf. The true eſſence, the force &amp; virtue of the Sacrament, is without doubt in the ſenſe of theſe other terms,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>Luk</hi> 22.19.</note> 
                  <hi>which is broken for you; do this, and do it in remembrance of me; and to ſhew forth my death until I come,</hi> which is the ſenſe in which St. <hi>Paul</hi> explicates theſe lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter words of our Saviours: for Jeſus Chriſt gives his body,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> 11.</note> onely as it was broken for us; and his bloud as pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out for our ſins. This is properly the Myſtery of our ſalvation, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation of our ſins, the accompliſhment of the Law. Theſe are the words properly, which make the true like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs betwixt the Euchariſt, and the ſacrifice of the Croſs; betwixt the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and the thing ſignified by the Sacrament. We ought to take them altogether, to form a true Idea of this Myſtery; and it may be truly ſaid, that it is onely for not taking them altogether, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is fallen into all theſe errours which make us ſeparate from her. If inſtead of inſiſting ſo much, as ſhe
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:37449:133"/>
doth upon theſe firſt words, <hi>this is my body,</hi> ſhe had weighed a little more the following words, <hi>which is broken for you,</hi> ſhe would doubtleſs have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, that Jeſus Chriſt having not yet ſuffered death when he ſpake them, and nevertheleſs giving his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy as broken, and in a ſtate of death, his intention could not be, that his proper body was really in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and leſs yet that it was there in a ſtate of life, ſuch as the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it: If inſtead of inſiſting ſo much as ſhe doth upon the firſt words, ſhe had alſo weighed a little more thoſe other, <hi>do this in remembrance of me,</hi> ſhe would have alſo underſtood thereby, that the ſenſe of theſe words imports, that Jeſus Chriſt kept aloof from, and did not at all put himſelf in the place of the bread: and to conclude, if ſhe had a little better weighed theſe laſt words, <hi>drink ye all of this,</hi> inſtead of inſiſting onely upon the former, ſhe had never proceeded ſo far, as to take away the cup in the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>But to return to the point on which
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:37449:133"/>
we are here principally concerned: what hath been now ſaid, doth not onely ſhew, the relation there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the bread and the body of Jeſus Chriſt, but doth wholly overthrow the conſequence of the Biſhop of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>'s Argument; to wit, <hi>that Jeſus Chriſt did not on this ſay any thing to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain himſelf, as he was careful to doe in the other figures, or in other parables.</hi> For in the firſt place, we know, that Jeſus Chriſt did not explain generally all the Figures he uſed; whether it were, that he would leave ſome exerciſe for our Faith and meditation, or that he thought them ſufficiently intelligible of themſelves, as we do pretend that this very paſſage is.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If this Figure had not been ſo plainly intelligible of it ſelf, it hath been already ſhewed, that Jeſus Chriſt had prepared the Apoſtles to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it; having told them, that theſe ſorts of expreſſions were to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood ſpiritually. And to conclude,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>John</hi> 6 63.</note> how can it be ſaid, that Jeſus Chriſt <hi>ſaid nothing to explain himſelf?</hi> If our Lord had ſaid no more but theſe
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:37449:134"/>
words, <hi>this is my body,</hi> as the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> onely frames his Argument upon theſe words, it might ſeem ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what leſs ſtrange, that they ſhould dare to ſpeak thus to us; but Jeſus Chriſt ſaid all in the ſame breath, <hi>this is my body which was broken for you, doe this in remembrance of me:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.24. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.29.</note> 
                  <hi>This is the New Teſtament in my bloud which is ſhed for many.

                  <hi>that as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do ſhew the Lords death till he come.</hi> What greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, or rather, what greater clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs can be deſired in a Myſtery, to give to underſtand, that Jeſus Chriſt leaving his Apoſtles, and ſpeaking to them, as it were, his laſt Farewel, left them this Sacrament, as an earneſt, a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial, and a ſeal of the death which he ſuffered for them and for us?</p>
               <p>

me,</hi> is no longer <hi>the Traveller that thoſe follows the great High way;</hi> I mean, <hi>words,</hi> he no longer underſtands the words of our Lord, according to the letter. The literal and natural ſenſe of theſe laſt words altogether, <hi>Do this in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of me,</hi> is this; that we ſhould do what Jeſus Chriſt ordained, to put us in remembrance of him: for it is Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt that ſaith <hi>in remembrance of me.</hi> But the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what detorts this ſenſe, and would have it, that the intention of our Lord, ſhould be only to oblige us to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber his death; under pretence that the Apoſtle concludes with theſe words, that <hi>we ſhew forth the death of our Lord.</hi> It is not difficult to comprehend, what this the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi>'s little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion tends to, namely, that if this be the ſenſe of thoſe words, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me,</hi> we ought to call to remembrance the very perſon of Jeſus Chriſt. This ſenſe leads us naturally to believe, that the divine perſon that we ought to call to remembrance, is not really preſent: For, according to the manner of uſual conceiving and
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:37449:135"/>
ſpeaking amongſt men, to call to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, is properly of perſons ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: Otherwiſe, ſuppoſing the real preſence of Jeſus Chriſt in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, the ſenſe and the <hi>Idea</hi> which theſe words carry, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me,</hi> is this, Eat my proper body, to call your ſelves to remembrance of me in my preſence, or as if I were preſent; which makes but an odd and inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent ſenſe. In the mean time, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the nature of the thing, that is to ſay, Jeſus Chriſt, who was now about to leave the Apoſtles, nor his expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions at all ſuffer us to doubt, but that he requires preciſely theſe two things, to wit, to call our ſelves to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of him, by an act of love and acknowledgment, and that we medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate alſo on his death, as an effect of his love, and the price of our Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Condom,</hi> very far from acknowledging, that to call to remembrance, as our Lord requires, ſuppoſes his abſence, turns the thing to the clear contrary, ſo as to infer,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:37449:135"/>
that this very remembrance ſhould be grounded upon the real preſence. To this purpoſe, he here brings in again the compariſon of the ſacrifices. <hi>As,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Jewes in eating the Peace-offerings, did call to remembrance that they were offered for them, ſo in eating the fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt our ſacrifice, we ought to call to remembrance that he dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for us:</hi> and from thence he paſſeth unto a kind of Rhetorical rapture up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the tender remembrance, which the Tombs of the Fathers excite in the childrens hearts.</p>
               <p>Firſt, as to what concerns the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, we have already ſaid that it is not a proof, and that upon the whole caſe, the relation there is of the Law to the Goſpel, is no reaſon that we ſhould take all according to the letter in the Goſpel, as we do for the moſt part matters in the Law: that on the contrary it is ſufficient, that our ſpiritual eating of the body of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, anſwers unto the Oral eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſacrifices, which were the Figure of his ſacrifice.</p>
               <p>But there is yet more in it: the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:37449:136"/>
of <hi>Condom</hi> onely ſpeaks of Peace-offerings, and remembers not himſelf of what he himſelf had ſaid of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice offered for ſins, which is the true Figure of the ſacrifice of Jeſus Chriſt upon the Croſs. May not his argument be returned back againſt himſelf, that as the <hi>Jewes</hi> did not eat of this expiatory ſacrifice, and yet for all that failed not to remember, that it was offered for their ſins, in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner it is not neceſſary that we ſhould eat the proper fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt our ſacrifice, to put us in remembrance of his death. We have this advantage of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> that they ate nothing inſtead of this ſacrifice, whereas we eat the holy Symbols, which livelily repreſent unto us the body and bloud of Jeſus Chriſt; his body broken for us, and his bloud poured out for the expiation of our ſins.</p>
               <p>Further, what are our manners, and our education, that to put us in a tender remembrance of the death of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, we muſt needs eat his proper fleſh with our bodily mouth? Or rather, if it be true that the
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:37449:136"/>
remembrance, which is the thing in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, be nothing elſe but an apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion excited by the objects which affect the ſenſe, has the manner, in which it is believed they eat this fleſh in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> any thing which doth more affect the ſenſes, than ours? ſeeing, that we eat it, both one and the other, under the ſame kindes or forms of bread and wine.</p>
               <p>We will not here enquire, whether it excite a real tenderneſs, to conceive that we effectively eat the fleſh, which we love and adore; or if on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary it be not by degrees, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, is become ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed unto this conceipt, which of it ſelf doth ſtir up contrary affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>It will be onely needful to compare the manner, how they adminiſter the Sacraments in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> with that wherein they adminiſter them in our Churches, to judge which of the two is moſt capable to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a true remembrance of the death of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>The Church of</hi> Rome <hi>believes, ſhe holds the proper fleſh of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:37449:137"/>
Chriſt under the ſacred coverts of bread and wine, as it were under a myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Tomb, or under dead ſigns, but a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and vivifying fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe be the terms of the Biſhop of <hi>Condom,</hi> which form a notion or Idea very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plext and contradictory; as if we ſhould ſay, a dead body full of life, and the fountain of life, under the coverts of death. Which is the very cauſe that this Idea, being ſo confuſed, is not without much difficulty received into the mind, and that it there makes the leſs impreſſion, or at leaſt doth not make ſo lively an impreſſion onely of the death of Jeſus Chriſt, of which the main queſtion here is: whereas amongſt us, where we onely regard the bread broken, and the wine poured out, but as an image and repreſentation of the body of Jeſus Chriſt broken for us, and his bloud ſhed for us, This image doth give unto us a clear and diſtinct Idea of the death, which Jeſus Chriſt hath ſuffered for us; which is properly the effect which our Lord would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce in the Sacrament.</p>

The Conſecration being done, if he gives the Hoſt, for every one knows that there are infinite Maſſes without communicants, he ſaith not unto them who do receive it, that the body of Jeſus Chriſt was broken for them, which is properly what he ought to ſay unto them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the words of our Saviour, to imprint well in their minds the Idea of his death, and to excite in their hearts a pure ſenſe, and ſuch which becomes hearts engaged in love and acknowledgment of this Divine Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; but it is onely ſaid unto them, by form of a Petition which is made for them, <hi>the body of Jeſus Chriſt keep or preſerve their ſouls unto eternal life:</hi> and though we do not here repeat this form of Petition, to condemn it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is good, and of ancient uſe, yet it may be ſaid, that it is a more ſelf-intereſſed conſideration, which makes them not to reflect, but onely upon
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:37449:138"/>
their own profit and advantage; and which is more, the Prieſt ſayes this it ſelf in the ſame Latine Tongue, which the greateſt part doe not underſtand. In very truth, what ſound remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, or what true ſenſe of love and thankfulneſs, can this kind of ſetting forth the death of the Lord, all in a low mumbling tone, in general terms, &amp; in a Language ill underſtood, excite? We ſpeak of a ſound remembrance, &amp; of a love with underſtanding: for as for an outward devotion, or confuſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments of Holineſs, it is not deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but that the way of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, being full of pomp, may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite as much as, or more than ours, which is more ſimple.</p>

<pb n="257" facs="tcp:37449:138"/>
devotion, which conſiſt in Prayers, ſinging of Pſalms, and reading porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the holy Scriptures, moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per unto the ſubject, there is ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Sermon made to us, expreſly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the death of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, or upon the Sacraments themſelves. The Sermon is followed with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Prayer alſo upon the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: the Prayer being ended, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter doth read unto us publickly, with a loud voice, the Liturgy of the Lords Supper, which contains princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally the manner, wherein St. <hi>Paul</hi> relates that our Saviour did inſtitute it, with another exhortation well to prepare our hearts. Laſtly, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter taking the bread and the wine, ſaith with a loud voice, <hi>The bread which we break, is the body of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>the communion of the body of Jeſus Chriſt. The Cup which we bleſs, is the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt, which was poured out for your ſins:</hi> Or, <hi>the Cup which we bleſs, is the communion of the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> for either one or the other of theſe expreſſions are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently uſed, the grace of God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:37449:139"/>
to us, not being tyed unto the words. After which, in diſtributing the Bread to the communicants, the Miniſter ſaith again unto them, to raiſe and awaken their zeal and their faith, <hi>This is the body of Jeſus Chriſt, which was broken for you;</hi> and in giving the Cup, <hi>This is the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt which was ſhed for your ſins,</hi> or ſome words to this ſenſe. And laſt of all, when every one hath done communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating, we conclude with thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, in ſinging the ſong of <hi>Simeon,</hi> and with the Bleſſing, wherewith the Miniſter diſmiſſeth the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</p>
               <p>This particular account is onely for them, who are miſinformed of our practice. We appeal here to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of all ſincere perſons in the firſt place, if it be not true, that this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of celebrating, and of giving, and receiving the Sacrament of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, be not moſt conform unto what we ſee in the inſtitution of our Lord, and unto the practice of the Apoſtles, and of the firſt and pureſt Ages of Chriſtianity; and without compariſon,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:37449:139"/>
more conform than that of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And in the ſecond place, which of theſe two manners of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating, is the moſt proper to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite and nouriſh true piety, according to knowledge, and a ſincere remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the death of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>There remaines no more as to this point, but to touch the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi>'s laſt conſideration, in which he ſaith, <hi>That we do not deny the real communication of the ſubſtance of the Son of God in the Lords Supper; ſo that there is a neceſſity that we ſhould agree, that the remembrance doth not exclude all manner of preſence, but only that which doth ſtrike our ſenſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We do not indeed ſay, that remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance excludes all manner of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; for on the contrary, it is ſaid of remembrance, as it is of Faith, that it makes things to be preſent, that are at the greateſt diſtance. There is a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral preſence, and a myſtical preſence, a preſence of object &amp; of virtue, as they ſpeak; which are not incompatible with remembrance. For example, the Heavens, the Stars, though almoſt at
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:37449:140"/>
an infinite diſtance, are in ſome ſort preſent with us, not onely becauſe we ſee them, but by the influences which they caſt upon us. We onely ſay, that remembrance excludes a preſence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, perſonal, and as it were phyſical, local, and immediate, under the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours and exteriour appearances of Bread and Wine, ſuch as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> teacheth of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, in the hands of a Prieſt, or in the mouth or ſtomach of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants.</p>
               <p>But becauſe both here and elſewhere the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> grounds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon what he ſaith, that at the ſame time that we deny this real pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt in the Sacrament, we teach a real partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of his Body, and that upon this occaſion, the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> here makes an expreſs Article of the Expoſition of our Belief upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, what we will ſay of our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine upon this point, ſhall ſerve for an anſwer unto all the conſequences which he draws both here, or elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>

               <p>Let us be permitted, before we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon this Article, to complain, that the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> doth at the very firſt, here begin to treat us in termes prohibited by the Edicts of our Kings, at the ſame time alſo charging us with affected equivocations, which in no wiſe agree with the ſimplicity of our Doctrine. we are apt to think, that it is the heat of diſpute, which hath here inſenſibly tranſported him beyond his natural equity, and we would not at all concern our ſelves to take notice of theſe ſorts of expreſſions, eſpecially in a time wherein we are accuſtomed unto more ſtrict dealings, if the leaſt thing of this nature, proceeding from a perſon of his dignity, and for whom we have a great eſteem, were not more
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:37449:141"/>
remarkable, and of worſe example, than all the bittereſt things that might be ſaid by other perſons.</p>
               <p>This Article of the Biſhop of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>'s Treatiſe, though more copious, is for all that obſcure and intangled, full of repetitions, of digreſſions, and of compariſons (odious and beſides his buſineſs) which he makes of us, to <hi>Socinians, Arrians, Neſtorians, Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians,</hi> inſulting over us upon words, contrary to what appears manifeſtly to be our ſenſe. But we will leave the words, and apply our ſelves to the things.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, inſtead of giving a plain and intire Expoſition of our Belief, and afterwards drawing the conſequences which he had a mind of, he onely gives it by ſhreds, and ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plext, that it cannot be underſtood. He onely reports here and there ſome of our Expreſſions, ſeparate from each other, endeavouring therein to find ſome obſcurity; and afterwards, he grounds upon this obſcurity, which himſelf hath made, the equivocations and contradictions which he imputes
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:37449:141"/>
unto us. We need onely take notice, what courſe he takes in the very en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, to make a judgment that he ſpeaks after his own manner, and not after ours. <hi>Their Doctrine,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>hath two parts; the one ſpeaks onely of the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the body and bloud, the other ſpeaks onely of the reality of the body and bloud.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Diviſions are wont to give order, and to give light unto diſcourſes: but this on the contrary, doth at firſt ſight ſo little ſet forth our Doctrine, that our people would not underſtand it. The explication which follows, is neither juſter, nor more natural. Inſtead of laying down what we believe affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matively, he layes down indeed but onely the negative part of our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</p>
               <p>Wherefore we ſhall do better to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain our own Doctrine our ſelves in a few words, with relation unto what the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> ſayes hereof. This ſhall be that plain Form of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which he ſaith we have not, and ſhall ſerve for a general refutation of all that he hath produced. We will not
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:37449:142"/>
forbear anſwering afterwards unto whatſoever he ſhall oppoſe, that is moſt conſiderable.</p>
               <p>Our Doctrine is ſimple, as the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> ſaith that it ought to be, incomparably more ſimple, than that of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Here, as well as elſewhere, we have this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> believes all that we do believe: the difference is onely in the things which ſhe adds, and which we cannot believe.</p>
               <p>We believe that Jeſus Chriſt having taken our humane nature, to ſuffer the death which we had deſerved, it was neceſſary that we ſhould be united un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, as the members are united un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the head, to the end, that his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and his righteouſneſs, ſhould be imputed unto us, that we might par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of all his merits.</p>
               <p>We ſay, that this union is made on our part, by the faith which we have in him: that it is God himſelf who gives us this Faith, and that to give it unto us, and to confirm it in our hearts, he maketh uſe of two ſundry ſorts of means; the one interiour, which is the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:37449:142"/>
ſecret operation of his Holy Spirit, without which thoſe others were in vain; the others exteriour, which are the Word, and the Sacraments of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm and the Lords Supper, the Word, to declare unto us the promiſes of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; Baptiſm, more particularly, to ſhew forth our Entrance into the Church, and the waſhing away of our ſins; and the Lords Supper, to ſhew forth yet more perfectly the death of Jeſus Chriſt, and our communion with him. Hitherto we go along with the Gentlemen of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. They believe, as we doe, that it is neceſſary we be ſpiritually united unto Jeſus Chriſt, that this Union is made by Faith, that it is the Holy Spirit which produces this Faith in our hearts, and that the Word, Baptiſm, and the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, are the outward means, which the Holy Spirit makes uſe of, whether to produce, or to increaſe and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Faith in our hearts. If there be any difference about this, betwixt the Gentlemen of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church and us, it is not about what we have now ſaid, but upon thoſe ſeveral other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:37449:143"/>
which ſhe hath added.</p>
               <p>As to the Euchariſt in particular, whereof here the Queſtion is betwixt them and us, we alſo ſay very plainly, that the Bread and Wine are outward ſigns, which Jeſus Chriſt hath added unto the Word, to ſet forth his death before our eyes more livelily, &amp; more ſenſibly, than by Baptiſm, or by the Goſpel; and that when we receive theſe ſigns by Faith, Jeſus Chriſt gives himſelf unto us; or that he confirmes the gift which he hath already made unto us, of himſelf in Baptiſm, or in the preaching of the Goſpel, for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating to us all his benefits. Not that his body is in the bread, and his blood in the Wine, or under the forms of bread and wine, but by lifting our hearts up unto heaven, where he is, and uniting us unto himſelfe by his holy ſpirit. This is truly the abridgment of our Doctrin, drawne from our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith, and our catechiſme, conformable unto what the ſcriptures teach us throughout, of the ſpirituall union of the faithful with our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. There is nothing in all this,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:37449:143"/>
which is not plain and eaſie to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, excepting onely the ineffable &amp; incomprehenſible manner, in which this holy Spirit worketh in us, and whereby he effects this union of the faithful, with Jeſus Chriſt our Divine Head.</p>
               <p>Yet we have ſome reſemblances, though very imperfect,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.30, 31, 32. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16, 17.</note> as well of this operation of the holy Spirit in our hearts, as of the union of the faithful with Jeſus Chriſt, in the conjugal love which unites husband and wife, and which is the reaſon that the Scripture ſaith, that they are but one body and one ſoul.</p>
               <p>However the matter ſtands, it is very obſervable in this caſe, that this difficulty, ſuch as it is, is common with us and them of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that it proceeds not more or leſs from hence, that our Doctrine is different from theirs. They believe (the ſame as we do) the ſpiritual u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Faithful with Jeſus Chriſt, by the operation of the holy Spirit, as we have juſt now ſaid, as well in the preaching of the Goſpel, as in Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:37449:144"/>
and the Euchariſt. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not at all this ſpiritual union a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny better than we, nor explain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves otherwiſe therein than we do; and what they believe more than we in the Sacrament, to wit, that they receive the proper body of Jeſus Chriſt, by the mouth of the body into their ſtomach, doth not add any thing at all, according to their own princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, either to effect, or make un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood this ſpiritual union, which we have with Jeſus Chriſt, which is the onely and true cauſe of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For they do not deny, that thoſe who receive Baptiſm without the Word, and without the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, or Baptiſm and the Word with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſame Euchariſt, may be ſaved, and united perpetually unto Jeſus Chriſt, as well as they who receive alſo the Euchariſt. Neither do they ſay, that the body of Jeſus Chriſt, which they do believe they receive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their ſtomach, is united unto their ſoul, or unto their body, by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; nor even that the ſubſtance of their body, or of their ſoul, doth
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:37449:144"/>
touch the ſubſtance of the body and bloud of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>They ſay onely, that their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance doth touch the ſenſible Forms of Bread and Wine, and that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al preſence of the body of Jeſus Chriſt, under theſe Formes, is an earneſt unto them of their ſpiritual union with Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. Some alſo add, that it is unto them a bloſſoming of life and immortality by its virtue, without pretending for all that, that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of their ſoul or body, doth join or unite it ſelf unto the ſubſtance of the body and bloud of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Let us now ſee, wherein the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> doth pretend that we uſe Equivocations, or that we come near unto the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> To render his accuſation the more plauſible, he begins with the reaſon, which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends hath, as it were, forced us to come nearer unto the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the point of the reality; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, he paſſeth unto the objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which he makes to prove, that in effect we are come nearer unto them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="270" facs="tcp:37449:145"/>
                  <hi>It is ſufficient,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to have learned by the Scriptures, that the Son of God would teſtifie his love unto us, by incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible effects: This love,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>was the cauſe of this ſo real union, by which he became man: this love induced him to offer up for us that his body, as really as he had taken it; and all theſe deſigns are followed, and this love is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained throughout by the ſame fervour: So whenſoever it ſhall pleaſe him to make any of his children ſenſible of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which he hath expreſſed unto all in general, by giving himſelf to them in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, he will find a means to ſatisfie himſelf by things that are as effectual, as thoſe which he hath already accompliſhed for our Salvation. Wherefore it is not to be wondred at, if he gives unto every one of us the proper ſubſtance of his Fleſh, and of his Bloud; he doth it to imprint in our hearts, that it is for us that he took them, and that it is for us that he offered them as a ſacrifice.</hi> And a little afterwards he adds, <hi>Our adverſaries have very well ſeen, that ſimple figures, and ſimple ſigns of the body and bloud of Jeſus Chriſt, would not ſatisfie Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:37449:145"/>
accuſtomed to the bounty of a God, which gives himſelf ſo really unto us: therefore it is, that they would not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed to deny this real participation of Jeſus Chriſt in their Sacrament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Behold here the reaſon, that he ſaith hath forced us to approach unto the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> but Chriſtians are then either very ingrateful, or very difficult to be contented, if they are not ſatisfied that Jeſus Chriſt died for them, that theſe ſacred ſigns aſſure them of it, and that they ſerve them as an effectual and ſaving means, to raiſe their hearts and their Faith unto Jeſus Chriſt. They have then the ears of their underſtanding cloſe ſtopped, if it be true, that theſe ſacred ſignes joyned unto the Word, do not yet tell them plainly, and loud enough, that Jeſus Chriſt became man for them, that his body was broken for them; and that laſtly, his bloud was poured out for the remiſſion of their ſins.</p>
               <p>The Opinion, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> adds, that Jeſus Chriſt is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, being very far from better ſetting forth his death, incumbers, as I may
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:37449:146"/>
ſo ſay, the conception of it, as hath been ſhewed before, becauſe it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents the body of Jeſus Chriſt in a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſtate, under dead ſigns: and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the way of giving theſe ſignes, in a language not underſtood, or ill underſtood, makes much leſs impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the hearts, than the way, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it hath been ſhewed, they are given amongſt us.</p>
               <p>But in fine, where is the reaſon of this conſequence? The Love which Jeſus Chriſt hath for us, induced him to dye really for us; therefore it is the part of this Love, to give really unto us the proper ſubſtance of his fleſh, and of his bloud. What bond, or what neceſſary conſequence is there of one and the other of theſe things? From what time, and in what place, hath it been known or uſual, that it is a ſign of love in any to give his proper fleſh to eat, to them whom he loves? I do not ſay, onely by morſels, as ſome poſſibly may ſay the <hi>Capernaites</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the words of our Saviour, but in any manner or under any coverts under which it may be put? For, although God
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:37449:146"/>
doth teſtifie his Love unto us by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible effects, though his ways are not our ways, grace doth not, for all that, deſtroy nature; his ways are above our ways, and even contrary to what ours have of evil, and irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; but not at all to what they have that is good and right, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from God himſelf. What there is incomprehenſible in the effects of his Love, is nothing as to the manner, as we may ſay, but to the degree, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the infinity of this Love it ſelf: For as to the other point, we in ſome ſort conceive all, that this infinite Love makes him do for us, by a compariſon though very imperfect, of what an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Love doth make us doe one for another. To pay for another, is the true office of a Friend; and to dye for another, hath always paſſed for a true teſt of Love;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.13.</note> 
                  <hi>Greater Love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his Friends.</hi> To dye for an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, is a generoſity that hath had no example amongſt men, before the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Jeſus Chriſt dyed for us, who were origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:37449:147"/>
his creatures, but were become his enemies. This is that, which this Love hath in it incomprehenſible; and nevertheleſs, this Love, which was foretold by the prophets, was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed in the time that was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told.</p>
               <p>But neither propheſie, nor reaſon, nor humane manners ever yet taught us, that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould give us his real fleſh to eat, with the mouth of our body, as a token of the Love that he hath for us: and when Jeſus Chriſt ſaid unto his Diſciples,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>John</hi> 6.</note> 
                  <hi>That he would give his fleſh for the life of the world, and that whoſoever did not eat his fleſh, had no life in him,</hi> ſeeing that this word offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many, it doth not appear unto us, that our Saviour condemned their ſurpriſe, but onely that he preſently explained this ſpeech unto them, and that he made them underſtand, that they ſhould receive it ſpiritually.</p>
               <p>The Gentlemen of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church do always fall into this error, that although they do not directly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that the communion which we have with Jeſus Chriſt by Faith, is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

real, &amp; of its ſelf ſufficing to ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as they do confeſs in particular of the communion which we have with him, either by the Word, or by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, nevertheleſs always, when there is any mention of the Myſtery of the Euchariſt, they have this impreſſion reigning in their minds, which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bears all others, that Jeſus Chriſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give himſelf really unto them, but when they believe, that he gives his proper fleſh to be eaten with the mouth of their body. It is from this appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion; that the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> faith here again, <hi>that Jeſus Chriſt makes as taſt his bounty by things as effectual, as thoſe which he accompliſhed for our ſalvation:</hi> as if the Faith which he gives as, and the communion which we have with him by his Spirit, even out of the Euchariſt, were not all of theſe effectual things, and as effectual, as it is true that he dyed for us.</p>

And who ſaith a true and real union with Jeſus Chriſt, ſaith he any thing leſs, than to be made partaker of, or to be nouriſhed and vivified, with his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance? Doth either the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> himſelf better underſtand, or
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:37449:151"/>
is it poſſible, that he ſhould make bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter underſtood, the manner wherein he doth believe, that the bread and the wine are tranſubſtantiated into the body and bloud of Jeſus Chriſt, by the operation of the ſame ſpirit of God, inſomuch, that the bread doth ceaſe to be bread, and that the body of our Divine Saviour, his proper bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which is ſitting in Heaven at the right hand of the Father, is neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs upon Earth, in a thouſand places at once, after the manner of a ſpirit, in leſs room than a point doth take up. In fine, is it poſſible to make better underſtood this other manner, which he believes, that this holy body, which onely paſſeth through his ſtomach, doth unite, or rather is not united, with his proper body and ſoul.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Objection, which the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> here makes againſt us, is upon another expreſſion of our Catechiſm,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sunday</hi> 52.</note> where it is ſaid, <hi>that though Jeſus Chriſt be truly communicated unto us by Baptiſm, and by the Goſpel, it is onely in part, and not fully,</hi> whence the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> infers, that Jeſus
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:37449:151"/>
Chriſt is fully given unto us in the Lords Supper, and that there is an exceeding difference betwixt recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in part, and receiving fully. Granting this, ſee whereunto his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentation amounts.</p>
               <p>If in the Lords Supper,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pa.</hi> 106.</note> Jeſus Chriſt is fully received; and in Baptiſm, and in the Goſpel, but in part, then the manner in which he is received in the Lords Supper, is different from that in which he is received in the Goſpel, and in Baptiſm: Now the manner, in which he is received in Baptiſm, and in the Goſpel, is by Faith; Therefore it muſt needs be, that there ſhould be a real manner of receiving the body and bloud of our Lord in the Sacrament, which is not by Faith.</p>
               <p>By any the leaſt Attention to his Argument, it will at firſt ſight be found faulty. In ſumme, it is certain, there is in it a kind of ſophiſm; Of a thing which is onely true in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards, he draws conſequences, as if it were abſolutely true, and in all r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards: He changes the terms of the Propoſitions, as we ſpeak in the
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:37449:152"/>
Schools; and he puts more in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, than there is in the propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whence the concluſion ſhould be formed. It is almoſt as if a man ſhould ſay, the manner of a mans going is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and different from that of beaſts: the beaſt goeth upon his feet; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men do not go upon their feet: Or to make all more plainly to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, by an example which hath nearer relation unto the ſubject here in queſtion. The Argument of the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> is much like unto this: The Sun at Noon-day commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates to us objects, or the ſight of objects, in a full manner, and different from that in which he communicates them unto us at his riſing; or if you will in a different manner, from that wherein Torches communicate them unto us in the night: Now the Sun at his riſing, and Torches in the night, do communicate objects onely by the light; therefore the Sun at Noon-day, doth not communicate the objects un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us by the light. Or to form a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion upon the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi>'s very terms; therefore it needs muſt
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:37449:152"/>
be, that there is ſomething in the Sun at Noon-day, which cauſeth a manner of communicating objects, which is not by the light.</p>
               <p>The Sophiſm lies herein, that the difference of the manner whereby the Sun communicates the objects at Noonday, from that whereby it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates them at his riſing, or that whereby Torches communicate them in the night, is in truth onely in the more or leſs of the light; a difference in degree, as we ſpeak, and not in kind, in the means it ſelf, rather than in the effect, becauſe theſe divers manners fail not to communicate the ſame objects, though with more or leſs clearneſs: whereas it is plain that this argument concludes, that there is in the Sun at Noonday ſomething elſe, than the light, which makes this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</p>
               <p>But leaving the form of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to follow the thing it ſelf: if the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> would have pleaſed to have taken the ſenſe of the Article of the Catechiſm intirely, as it had been juſt, he would have ſeen, that he
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:37449:153"/>
had not the leaſt pretext to play with words as he doth.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sunday</hi> 52.</note> The Catechiſm having laid down, that the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which we have with Jeſus Chriſt, is not onely in the Sacrament, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in preaching the Word of God, the Miniſter demands, <hi>What is it that the Lords Supper adds unto the VVord;</hi> or <hi>what have we more in the Lords Supper, and what is its uſe? This,</hi> ſaith the Child, <hi>that in the Lords Supper, our communion is more fully confirmed, and as it were ratified:</hi> after which it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately adds, <hi>that though Jeſus Chriſt be truly communicated unto us, by Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm, and by the Goſpel, it is but in part, and not fully.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe words taken together, do moſt clearly give to underſtand, that what the Sacrament of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per adds unto the Word, is not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner of communion with Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, more real in ſubſtance, or different in kind, from that which we have with him by the Miniſtry of the Word, or by Baptiſm: for Jeſus Chriſt being truly communicated by theſe three divers means, as the Catechiſm
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:37449:153"/>
it ſelf layes down, it cannot in any manner be underſtood, that Jeſus Chriſt can be as it were divided, and more or leſs communicated; Or that there is more union with him by the Lords Supper, than by Baptiſm, and by the preaching of the Word; but onely that in the Lords Supper, we have yet a new, and more ample con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of our union with Jeſus Chriſt, and as it were a final ratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which are the words of the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm.</p>
               <p>Baptiſm properly is inſtituted onely, to ſhew our entrance into the Church, and to let us underſtand, that as the water doth cleanſe our bodies, ſo the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt, doth waſh us from our ſins; and particularly, from our Original ſin, without repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more expreſly, either the death of Jeſus Chriſt, or our ſpiritual union with him: though upon the whole, the operation of the Holy Ghoſt, doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs thereby produce this ſpiritual union of the Faithful with Jeſus Chriſt, and the eternal happineſs of them which are baptiſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="288" facs="tcp:37449:154"/>The word doth very well repreſent unto us, the promiſe of Salvation, and all that depends thereon: it is a very effectual means to work Faith, and to unite us unto Jeſus Chriſt, when God is pleaſed to accompany it with his grace;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17.</note> for <hi>Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the VVord of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But whereas the Word onely works upon one of our ſenſes, the Euchariſt ſpeaks unto all our ſenſes in general; and we know, that the ſight in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular makes a greater impreſſion upon our ſpirits, than the hearing: and whereas Baptiſm onely ſets forth our entrance into the Church, and onely applyes or communicates unto us the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt by the form of waſhing; the Euchariſt doth yet more expreſly repreſent unto us, that the body of Jeſus Chriſt was broken for us, and that his bloud was poured out for the remiſſion of our ſins, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating both one and the other unto us, by the form of meat, and of drink. In a word, the Sacrament of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt gives us to underſtand, that as bread and wine nouriſh our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:37449:154"/>
ſo the body and bloud of Jeſus Chriſt nouriſh and vivifie our ſouls: and laſtly, that the bread and the wine are not more truly and really u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited unto our bodies, then Faith doth really and ſpiritually unite us unto the body of our Saviour. This is it, as every one may ſee, for which our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſm ſaith, that in the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, our communion with Jeſus Chriſt, is more amply confirmed and ratified unto us, than in Baptiſm, and in the preaching of the Goſpel: or that in Baptiſm, and in the Goſpel, Jeſus Chriſt is communicated in part unto us, and in the Lords Supper fully; for it is but one and the ſame thing, in the ſenſe of the Catechiſm.</p>
               <p>The manner in which Baptiſm communicates Jeſus Chriſt unto us, in admitting of us into the Church, may be compared, if we pleaſe, unto that wherein it was ſaid, that the Sun communicates the ſight of objects at his riſing: the manner in which the Word alſo communicates Jeſus Chriſt to us, in declaring unto us the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Goſpel, unto that of Torch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:37449:155"/>
communicating the ſame objects in the night: and Laſtly, the manner wherein the Euchariſt communicates the ſame Jeſus Chriſt unto us, by form of nouriſhment, that vivifies us, unto that of the Suns communicating alſo the ſame objects at full Noonday; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially if the Euchariſt be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as being added unto the Word, and unto Baptiſm, as the Catechiſm doth conſider it. Theſe three manners of communicating Jeſus Chriſt, are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent betwixt themſelves, becauſe that theſe three exteriour means, have each their proper way of working upon us, to produce, or to ſtrengthen Faith in our hearts, and to confirm our communion with Jeſus Chriſt, by the operation of the Holy Spirit. But it is alwayes Jeſus Chriſt whole and intire, which is communicated unto us by each of theſe three means; and it is alway by Faith, and by the operation of the Holy Spirit, which is the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner common to all thoſe three; as it is the ſight of the ſame objects which is communicated by Torches in the night, and by the Sun at his riſing or
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:37449:155"/>
at full Noonday, &amp; always by the light, which is the common mean to Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and to the Sun, to illuminate the objects.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>it is remarkable</hi> (ſaith the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> here) <hi>that how great a deſire ſoever the Reformers had to equal Baptiſm, and preaching to the Lords Supper, in that Jeſus Chriſt is therein truly communicated unto us, they did not dare to ſay in their Catechiſm, that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt was given unto us in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſubſtance in Baptiſm, and in preaching, as they have ſaid, in the Lords Supper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the reaſon of this difference may eaſily be gathered, from what hath been ſaid hitherto; it is, that when an Expoſition is made of the meanes, whereof God makes uſe to unite us unto him, every one ought to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of according to the proper uſe, for the which it is known they are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed. Our Catechiſm doth not ſay, that Jeſus Chriſt ſpiritually rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerates us in the Lords Supper, or that he waſheth us from our ſins, as it doth ſpeak of Baptiſm; nor that <hi>Faith comes by the Lords Supper,</hi> to uſe that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:37449:156"/>
of ſpeaking, that is to ſay, that the Lords Supper produces in our hearts Faith, as it is ſaid, that <hi>Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God:</hi> for that the Lords Supper is not inſtituted to repreſent unto us our union with Jeſus Chriſt under this notion, but to repreſent it unto us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the notion of a ſubſtantial union, ſuch as is that of nouriſhment. In like manner, if the Catechiſm ſaith not, that we are made partakers of the ſubſtance of Jeſus Chriſt in Baptiſm, or in the preaching of the Goſpel, as it ſaith of the Lords Supper, it is not but that in theſe very actions we are really united unto Jeſus Chriſt, or that Jeſus Chriſt doth not there ſpiritually nouriſh our ſouls with his ſubſtance, as really as he doth in the Sacrament; and the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> dares not ſay the contrary: but ſo it is, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though theſe divers means produce for the main the ſame effect, yet the ſame expreſſions do not equally agree to the one and the other, becauſe the water of Baptiſm, and the ſound of the Word, are not at all proper, as the
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:37449:156"/>

               <p>The third and laſt of our expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, upon which the Biſhop of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> ſtrains himſelf more than upon the former, is taken from an Article of our Catechiſm, which follows that which we have now examined. In the firſt Article it is ſaid, that in the Lords Supper we have a new and more ample confirmation of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion which we have with Jeſus Chriſt, by the preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel: here the Miniſter proceeds to demand, <hi>VVhat is it then in ſumme,</hi>

                  <hi>which we have by the ſign of bread?</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, On what, in fine, doth the uſe which we ſhould make of this Sacrament, terminate it ſelf; or what is the fruit of this confirmation, which you ſay, that we therein have of our communion with Jeſus Chriſt? The Child anſwers, <hi>It is this, that the body of Jeſus Chriſt, inaſmuch as it was once offered a ſacrifice to reconcile us unto
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:37449:157"/>
God, is given unto us, to certifie us that we have part in this reconciliation.</hi> This word <hi>certifie,</hi> is a word of thoſe very times, which ſignifies to aſſure us ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or to make us certain or aſſured of our reconciliation with God; and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one ſees, that the clear and intire ſenſe of this Anſwer is, that the union or communion which we have with Jeſus Chriſt, doth fully aſſure us that we have part in the fruit of his death.</p>

to ſpiritual, as if that which is ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, or which is ſpiritually effected, were not real.</p>
               <p>But to return to what the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> propoſes to himſelf upon this Article: it may be ſaid that this is one of thoſe forc'd arguments, the ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of which ſhews, that there is in it no more truth, than there is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. To anſwer unto it in ſuch a manner, as that we may underſtand ſomething, we muſt neceſſarily repeat his Propoſitions one after another, in the ſame terms that he conceived them: for putting them altogether, and all in conſequence, they make ſuch an entangled piece, as will create no ſmall difficulty to unravel.</p>

                  <hi>have any ſenſe,</hi> to wit, thoſe of the Catechiſm, <hi>if they be not an unprofitable ſound, and vain amuſement, they ſhould give us to underſtand, that Jeſus Chriſt doth not give us a Symbol onely but his true body, to aſſure us that we have an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in his ſacrifice.</hi>

But on the other ſide, this conſequence is uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs enough, though made with ſuch an ample and ſpecious preface. For we never brought into diſpute in the leaſt, whether without the Symbols, or with the Symbols, Jeſus Chriſt gives us not what is repreſented by the Symbols, that is to ſay, his body and bloud; the ſign, and the thing ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both together, and whether he gives us not both one and the other, to aſſure us that we have part in the fruit of his death.</p>

<pb n="297" facs="tcp:37449:158"/>
Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi>'s, is not a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence at all, for it adds nothing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt unto our ſenſe, nor unto our words.</p>
               <p>He forgets even under this head, to comprehend what we but now touched, which is not in queſtion nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but yet is thus far of this place, as that it conduces to form a compleat ſenſe of theſe words; namely, that not onely the body of Jeſus Chriſt, or the union which we have with him, doth aſſure us of the part which we have in the fruit of his death: but that the Symbols themſelves alſo aſſure us af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their manner, or according to the uſe for which God hath appointed them. For God makes uſe of theſe exteriour ſigns to affect our ſenſes, and to confirm our faith, and our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence.

                  <hi>aſſure us of participating of the fruit of his death, it muſt neceſſarily be, that this participation of the fruit, be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from the reception of the body; becauſe one is the earneſt of the other</hi> Here is it, that the intricacy and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity begins. To reaſon right, and more intelligibly, it had been needful to have reſumed, as was begun: <hi>If Jeſus Chriſt not onely gives us the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol of his body, but his body alſo, or his proper body, to aſſure us that we have part in his ſacrifice, and in the reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of mankind,</hi> we muſt then here diſtinguiſh the communion which we have of the body of Jeſus Chriſt, from the part which we have in the fruit of his death, ſeeing that the one doth aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure us of the other. Theſe are the terms of the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi>'s firſt propoſition, which agree with them of the Catechiſm: now the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> changes them, againſt the rule of diſputation, and this is it which creates not onely the intricacy, but alſo the Sophiſms; for that when we paſs from conſequence to conſequence,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:37449:159"/>
how little ſoever one term imports more or leſs than another, or expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes it with any difference in the ſenſe, or in the force of the word, we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert or aſtray; and this is called to take, or give the change.</p>
               <p>When the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> ſaith, that the reception of the body is an earneſt to us of the participation of the fruit of the death of Jeſus Chriſt, theſe three terms of <hi>Reception,</hi> of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation,</hi> and of <hi>Earneſt,</hi> which were not in the firſt propoſition, though they ſeem to anſwer to them which are there, being ſo imployed by oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition one to the other as they are here, do not ſo little alter the ſenſe, but that this change alone is the ſole founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Argument, and of all that there is captions in it.</p>
               <p>If the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> reſuming his firſt terms, had onely ſaid, that the communion of the body of our Lord aſſured us of the part which we have unto the fruit of his death, he had not had a word to ſay; becauſe that evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently imports but one and the ſame action, which cauſes that we are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:37449:160"/>
unto Jeſus Chriſt in the Lords Supper, and that being united unto him, we hold our ſelves aſſured of having ſhare in the fruit of his death. Nothing is more ſimple, and eaſie to be underſtood, than this: to have part in the fruit of the death of our Lord, is not here properly an action, it is properly but a right acquired. But in ſubſtituting to theſe words thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther terms, of <hi>Reeeption of the body,</hi> and of <hi>participation of the fruit,</hi> as the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> doth, it is a little colour, by the ſound of words, for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing two different actions in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion: and afterwards adding this expreſſion, <hi>that one is the earneſt of the other,</hi> this ſeems yet to make a greater diverſity. This foundation being once laid, in a nimble manner, and almoſt imperceptible to thoſe who only read curſorily, there is a long continuance of conſequences to attain unto two different communions of the body of Jeſus Chriſt. The mind of him that reads, perceives confuſedly, that he is led he knows not where, nor how; he onely findes that he is not led on
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:37449:160"/>
evenly, if it may be ſo ſaid, or that he is led amiſs.</p>
               <p>But let us not forget to reſume the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi>'s conſequences in the ſame terms that he hath concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them, for the better making known the defects. <hi>If the reception,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>of the body of our Lord, doth aſſure us of the participation of the fruit of his death, then this participation of the fruit, muſt neceſſarily be diſtinguiſhed from the reception of the body.</hi> In good time: let the mind diſtinguiſh the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which we have with the body, from the part which we have in the fruit; becauſe it is true that the body of the Lord, and the fruit of his death, are two different things, and may be conceived diſtinctly; as an inheritance which is given unto us, is different from the revenue which it brings us. But it is not neceſſary for all that, to diſtinguiſh the communion of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, from the part which we have in the fruit, as if we had not both one and the other of theſe two things, but by two different actions; even as, to make an inheritance, and the fruits of
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:37449:161"/>
the inheritance to be ours, it is not at all neceſſary to have two Titles, or two different contracts, the one for the inheritance it ſelf, and the other for the fruits, becauſe that the ſame Title ſerves for one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>He proceeds; <hi>If we muſt diſtinguiſh the participation of the body of our Lord, from the participation of the fruit of his death, we muſt alſo diſtinguiſh the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of this Divine body, from all that participation which is made ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and by Faith: for that the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation by Faith, cannot accommodate two different actions, by one of which we ſhould receive the body of our Saviour, and by the other the fruit of his ſacrifice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have already ſeen, that we muſt not ſeparate the communion of the body of the Lord, from the part which we have in the fruit of his death, as if there were two different actions; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there be two ſeveral objects which may be diſtinguiſhed, to wit, the body of the Lord, and the fruit of his death: So all this conſequence hath no foundation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="303" facs="tcp:37449:161"/>In ſumme, wherefore will the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> have two different acts of Faith, for uniting us to the body of Jeſus Chriſt, and having part in the fruit of his death, when it is evident that all is done, or might be done, by one and the ſame act of Faith.</p>
               <p>Or wherefore may we not even aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert two divers acts of Faith, if they be conceived ſeverally (by one of which we unite our ſelves to Jeſus Chriſt himſelf; and by the other, unto the fruit of his death) without any need to imagine, for all this, two dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent communions, one ſpiritual by Faith, and the other with the mouth of the body, or real, as the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> ſpeaks? <hi>Lord, draw us after thee, lift up our hearts unto thee, come dwell in our hearts by the operation of thy Spirit.</hi> Behold here an act of Faith, which unites us to Jeſus Chriſt, if the Faith be ſuch as it ought to be: and this union of its ſelf ſuffices, to effect that we ſhould alſo have part in the fruit of his death, by this one act of Faith. <hi>Lord, impute to us thy righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:37449:162"/>
and grant that being united unto thee by a true and lively Faith, we may have a ſhare in all thy benefits, and in particular, in the fruit of thy death:</hi> Behold here nevertheleſs, a ſecond act of Faith, which regards directly the part that we have in the fruit of his death. The difference of theſe two acts of Faith, properly will be onely in the diſtinction of the objects, which Faith doth propoſe unto it ſelf: in the one it propoſes the body of the Lord, and in the other the fruit of his death; and in one and the other, there is a real communion with our Saviour, but ſpiritually and by Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But no man,</hi> adds the Biſhop of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>

                  <hi>can conceive what difference there is betwixt participating by Faith of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of our Saviour, and to participate by Faith, of the fruit of his death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is now the ſecond or third time, that the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> will conceive all; Let us ſee if he will be of the ſame mind, upon the Article of Tranſubſtantiation, which follows immediately after this.</p>
               <p>But after all, how can he ſay, that
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:37449:162"/>
no man can conceive any difference betwixt participating by Faith of the body of the Lord, and participating by Faith of the fruit of his death? for the body of the Lord, and the fruit of his death, are evidently two different things, and there is no one who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eaſily conceive, that there is great difference betwixt partaking of the one, and partaking of the other, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be, that it is done by one act of Faith, or by two; though beſides, the manner of partaking of one and the other, be always the ſame, to wit <hi>ſpiritually, and by Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, it is here that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> cryes out again in fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing this Article, <hi>Who can but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the force of truth,</hi> &amp;c. And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, <hi>How ingenuouſly do the</hi> Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts <hi>confeſs unto us the truth? they would have been ſtrongly diſpoſed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, the body of Chriſt to be in the Sacrament in figure onely, and the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of his Spirit onely, in effect, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſide theſe great words of Participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of proper ſubſtance, and many others, which expreſs a real preſence, and which
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:37449:163"/>
onely cauſe perplexities,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Let the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> alſo in his turn, ingenuouſly confeſs the truth: he has been very ſtrongly diſpoſed, and many other intelligent perſons in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it may be, will be ſo with him, to confeſs that there is onely in the Euchariſt, a true and real communion of the body of Jeſus Chriſt, as we do acknowledge, that that which we there have ſpiritual, is very real, laying aſide that great word of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> as he had laid it aſide in the firſt Edition of his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe; that of <hi>concomitance,</hi> by virtue whereof the Cup was cut off from the communion; and many others which imply manifeſt contradiction, and which cauſe much more perplexity.</p>
               <p>That which is truly admirable in this place, is, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> teacheth, as we do, a ſpiritual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the body of Jeſus Chriſt, and the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> himſelf ſaid the very ſame but now, in expreſs terms, that <hi>in the Lords Supper there is a communion,</hi>

and of his ſpirit altogether, in receiving the fruit of his death;</hi> which is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the reſult of our Doctrine: and theſe words of participation, and of ſubſtance, with which the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> pleaſeth himſelf, and which he uſeth for all that himſelf, ſignifie nothing more. The onely difference that there is betwixt him and us, is, that we ſtop here; and that he, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this ſpiritual communion of the body of our Lord, ſuppoſes another <hi>real</hi> communion, as he ſpeaks, that is, with the mouth of the body, which we cannot allow of. Here, in another proſpect, he inſults over us, as if there could not be any other communion of the body of our Lord, but that onely which is had by the mouth of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and that without admitting of that, there can nothing be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in the Lords Supper, but the figure of his body, and a participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Spirit, excluding thus this other ſpiritual communion of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry body of Jeſus Chriſt, which he but now confeſſed.

<pb n="312" facs="tcp:37449:166"/>
ſuch a Doctrine as this? <hi>To exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe our Faith in this Myſtery.</hi> There is nothing ſo ſtrange, which might not be made paſs under ſuch indefinite pretexts of conveniency or agreeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: as if the Myſtery of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had not ſufficient matter beſides to exerciſe our Faith, without ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the change of the bread and wine into the proper fleſh, and proper bloud of our Saviour, againſt the formal te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of all our ſenſes.</p>
               <p>The fleſh and bloud, ſay they, would induce horrour, if we were to eat them in kind; and it is certain, that the very thought onely of eating hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane fleſh, doth naturally produce this effect: but it hath been already elſewhere touched, that the coverings, as they ſpeak, may leſſen his horrour, but not intirely take it away. And if the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be at laſt accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med unto this notion, it is but onely in tract of time, and in favour of that myſtical and figurative expreſſion in St. <hi>John,</hi>

               <p>But Laſtly, the difficulty is not to prove, that the appearances of bread and wine do remain, or to ſhew a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why they remain, but to ſhew, that there is nothing elſe but the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances that remains; for in the firſt place, Jeſus Chriſt, and the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who is his inſtrument, ſay, that after the benediction, <hi>it is bread and wine:</hi> and in the Apoſtles times, and in the firſt times after the Apoſtles, there was nothing ſpoken of but only <hi>bread and wine:</hi> And in fine, God having given unto us our ſenſes to know all corporal things, which are their true object, and which depend on their juriſdiction, their teſtimony being the foundation of almoſt all Notions, and the proof which Jeſus Chriſt made uſe of, to eſtabliſh the truth of his huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and of his Reſurrection, can the Biſhop of <hi>Condom,</hi> that will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand all, conceive, that God intended that in an act of Religion, which he eſtabliſhed to help our weakneſs and unbelief, in preſenting figures or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

And yet for all that, the Faith of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth not ſtop at the ſound of theſe words; but ſhe taketh the ſenſe, either in the figure of the words themſelves, or in the occaſion, and in the nature of the things.</p>
               <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> had before alledged the ſame reaſon, and almoſt in the ſame terms upon the point of the reality: and in effect, ſuppoſe that theſe words, <hi>this is my body,</hi> may be taken in a literal ſenſe, they could not be at all alledged for more than the
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:37449:168"/>
real preſence; but that nothing advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageth the particular Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation. For theſe words do not give the leaſt intimation, that the ſubſtance of bread and wine vaniſh, or that they be changed into the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the body and bloud of Jeſus Chriſt; but onely that the bread and wine, of which our Saviour ſpoke, were his body and bloud, in the ſenſe which our Saviour himſelf intended.</p>
               <p>Thoſe of the Confeſſion of <hi>Auſburg,</hi> have this common with the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, that they alſo underſtand our Saviours words in a literal ſenſe, for a real preſence: but in regard of the manner of this preſence, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to them is the <hi>impanation,</hi> or <hi>conſubſtantiation,</hi> as they ſpeak, that is to ſay, that the two ſeveral ſubſtances, that of bread, and that of the body of Jeſus Chriſt are in the Sacrament, they take their argument as well from the name of <hi>bread</hi> and <hi>wine,</hi> which the Scripture gives unto the ſign after the conſecration, as from the other To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks, whether of Scripture, or of the ſenſes and right reaſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="317" facs="tcp:37449:168"/>Further, Tranſubſtantiation being a Doctrine different from the real Preſence, which adds ſomething unto it, and which regards properly the manner of this Preſence (which thing is the reaſon alſo, that the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> makes it an Article diſtinct) it is neceſſary that the Biſhop of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> ſhould ſeek other reaſons for this Doctrine than theſe words, <hi>This is my body;</hi> or that he ſhould ſay, that he finds Tranſubſtantiation in theſe very words, by this conſequence which he draws thence, that the bread cannot be made the body of Jeſus Chriſt, but by this onely way of changing one ſubſtance into another: in which ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes he abandons his principle, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging that <hi>his Faith</hi> is not any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſo <hi>attentive</hi> to the words of our Saviour as not to call his reaſon to its aſſiſtance, to help him to comprehend not the power, nor the authority of him that ſpeaks, but the import and intire ſenſe of his words. And in this caſe things being brought to this point, behold here a way open to diſpute; We have right to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:37449:169"/>
whether the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> draws his conſequence well or ill. When it is ſaid, the Biſhop of <hi>Condom,</hi> we mean the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> and therefore it may yet be truly ſaid here, as well as upon all the other Articles, that the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi>'s Treatiſe, being very far from putting an end unto diſputes and objections, onely gives us occaſion to make new ones, upon the moſt important points of Faith.</p>
               <p>The third Aſſertion of the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi>'s upon this Article, is, that the reality of the Euchariſt, doth not hinder the Euchariſt's being a ſign. But this is again to change the terms of the Queſtion. The Queſtion is properly, Whether if the Sacrament being the ſign of the body and bloud of Jeſus Chriſt, that doth not hinder its being together the ſign, and the thing ſignified. This is the reaſon alſo, that the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that he did not proceed directly to the purpoſe, afterwards changes the propoſition, and changes it ſo Strongly on the other ſide, that he
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:37449:169"/>
reſolves <hi>the ſign</hi> to be <hi>a ſign of ſuch na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as to be ſo far from excluding the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, that it neceſſarily carries it with it: the reaſon is this,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that Jeſus Chriſt having ſaid, this is my body, this is a ſign that he is preſent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We confeſs we find it difficult to underſtand this arguing of the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi>'s; How can he ſay that the bread and the wine, which are the ſigns here in queſtion, are ſigns of ſuch nature, that they are ſo far from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the preſence of the body and bloud of Jeſus Chriſt, as neceſſarily to carry it with them? for this propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath no foundation in the nature of bread and wine. And for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> adds, that, Jeſus Chriſt having ſaid, <hi>this is my body</hi> is a ſign that he is preſent, is it not onely to play with words, and to make therewith but <hi>an empty ſound,</hi> and <hi>vain amuſement.</hi> This here again is called giving the change, and to prove the Queſtion by the thing it ſelf in queſtion. The Queſtion is, Whether the bread and wine are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the ſigns of the body and bloud
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:37449:170"/>
of Jeſus Chriſt, and the body and bloud of Jeſus Chriſt themſelves. We ſay, that ſigns, Symbols, Seals, and Pledges, are not the things themſelves whereof they are the ſigns, Symbols, Seals, and Pledges; and nothing is more conformable unto nature, and unto reaſon. The Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> ſaith, that the bread and the wine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the body and bloud of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>as to what they have inward,</hi> this hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders not, but that they may be ſigns, <hi>as to what they have outward, and ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:</hi> but this is onely to ſay what is in queſtion, and how doth he prove it? This ſpeech, <hi>this is my body, is a ſign that he is preſent;</hi> but here we treat of the ſigns of bread and wine, and this ſpeech it ſelf is not the ſign that you would have it to be, but onely by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it the literal ſenſe, which you give it, and this literal ſenſe alone, makes our firſt and principal que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
               <p>The fourth and laſt Aſſertion of the Biſhop of <hi>Condom,</hi> upon the Article of Tranſubſtantiation, is touching the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oration of the Hoſt. This Aſſertion

firſt manner of preſence in Heaven, and that excludes this other ſort of preſence upon Earth.</p>
               <p>But in the firſt place, this is to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer by the thing it ſelf which is in queſtion. To be able to ſpeak thus, it were neceſſary to ſhew us clearly, that the Apoſtle knew and believed this laſt ſort of preſence of Jeſus Chriſt upon Earth: and in the ſecond place, if the Apoſtle had believed that Jeſus Chriſt had been preſent in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at all times, when his Supper was celebrated, preſenting himſelf for us before the face of God, how could the Apoſtle have ſaid ſo abſolutely as he doth, that Jeſus Chriſt enters not into holy places made with hands, but that he is in Heaven, where he appears for us, without ſaying, at leaſt ſomthing that might have diſtinguiſhed the two different manners of appearing at the ſame time in Heaven, and upon the altars, and that the one doth not at all exclude the other? This can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be conceived. The other propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Apoſtles, is,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.25.</note> that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt doth not offer himſelf often, for
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:37449:175"/>
then muſt he often have ſuffered:</hi> The Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> on the contrary ſaith, that Jeſus Chriſt offers himſelf every day, becauſe that to offer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, there is no need that he ſhould dye any more. There is nothing more oppoſite than theſe two propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, and the reaſons upon which they are grounded, both one and the other: not to offer himſelf often, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it would be neceſſary he ſhould dye; to offer himſelf every day, becauſe it is not neceſſary he dye.</p>
               <p>It is in vain for the Biſhop of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> here again to hope to remove this contrariety, by aſſerting two manners of offering himſelf unto God; the one in ſuffering death, and the other in putting himſelf onely under the ſigns of death, and ſuppoſing that the Apoſtle onely ſpeaks of the former, and that he means Jeſus Chriſt doth not offer himſelf to dye often. For in the firſt place, this is again to anſwer the very thing that is in queſtion. It were neceſſary, I ſay, to have ſhewn, that the Apoſtle had acknowledged theſe two different wayes of offering
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:37449:175"/>
himſelf, the one in ſuffering death and the other without dying: but on the contrary, the Apoſtle ſpeaks abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, and without reſtriction, that Jeſus Chriſt doth not offer himſelf oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en. And what he adds, that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it had been neceſſary that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould often have dyed, doth not make a part of the Apoſtles pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, but onely the reaſon of his propoſition; otherwiſe the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles propoſition would amount unto this, that Jeſus Chriſt doth not dye often, becauſe he doth not dye often. If the Apoſtle had believed, that Jeſus Chriſt doth yet offer himſelf every day for us, it is evident, that he would not have ſaid in ſuch abſolute terms, that he doth not offer himſelf often, or that he would have ſaid ſomething that would have ſhewed theſe two different manners of offering himſelf, the one in dying, and the other in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelf onely under the ſign, or under the coverts of death, as the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> ſpeaks.</p>
               <p>It appears, that we muſt wilfully ſhut our Eyes to be able not to ſee,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:37449:176"/>
that all the doctrine of the ſacrifice of the Maſs, is directly oppoſite unto that of St. <hi>Paul.</hi> Nevertheleſs the weakneſs, or the variety of the mind of man is ſuch, that even from this it ſelf, the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> takes occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion yet to triumph upon this point, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring us to make ſerious reflexion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Doctrine, and upon the order, which he ſaith, providence holds in drawing us inſenſibly nearer unto the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</p>

<pb n="333" facs="tcp:37449:176"/>

<pb n="334" facs="tcp:37449:177"/>
in a word, that that of the <hi>Lutherans</hi> is but an errour of belief upon one point, and is not followed by any evil practice; whereas that of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church draws after it the Sacrifice of the Maſs, the adoration of the Hoſt, which are worſhips and practices, whereof the conſequence hath been already ſet forth.</p>
               <p>We will onely add in this caſe, that beſides that the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi>'s argument here is not good, and that there is on the contrary an equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, or change of ſenſe upon the word Reality (which makes a kind of Sophiſme) the Reality or the Real preſence, ſuch as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> believes it, by a change of the ſubſtance of bread into that of the body of Jeſus Chriſt, immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter theſe words <hi>this is my body</hi> are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, is the foundation of the Sacrifice of the Maſs, and of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oration of the Hoſt. This is the ſenſe of the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi>'s firſt propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, upon which we have nothing to ſay. God, ſaith he, hath permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the <hi>Lutherans</hi> continue firm
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:37449:177"/>
in the belief of the Reality. This is his ſecond propoſition, and here the equivocation begins, becauſe it is not true, that the <hi>Lutherans</hi> continue firm in the belief of the Reality, ſuch as the <hi>Roman</hi> Church ſuppoſeth it. They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not the preſence of the body of Jeſus Chriſt, but onely in the uſe of the Sacrament, as the Biſhop of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> himſelf affirms, that is to ſay, in the moment that they receive it: this is the reaſon that they admit not the Sacrifice of the Maſs, and adore not the Sacrament, believing that it is not there that Jeſus Chriſt will be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ored, and that it is ſufficient, that in receiving the Sacrament they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs their adoration unto Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, without circumſcription of place, as they ſpeak, that is to ſay, without conſidering him preciſely as being in the bread.</p>
               <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> goes on, God hath even permitted, that the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> have declared that this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine <hi>of the Reality</hi> hath no poyſon in it, and ought not to cauſe a ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion amongſt Brethren. This is the
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:37449:178"/>
Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi>'s third propoſition, where one may ſee the continuance of the equivocation upon the word Reality: for it is not of the belief of the Reality in general, that we have declared that it hath no poyſon in it, and that it ought not to break com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; but it is in particular of the belief of the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> in the terms in which they ſet it down. "Therefore ought the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> alſo to maintain the Sacrifice of the Maſs, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oration of the Hoſt, as natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of the Reality. This is the conſequence of the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi>'s argument: but every one ſees that it is a falſe conſequence, and beſides the Queſtion. This falſneſs is cauſed by the equivocation of the word, and by the ill manner of reaſoning; for the Reality of the <hi>Lutherans</hi> which we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of, is not the foundation of the Sacrifice of the Maſs, nor of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oration of the Hoſt, as is the Reality of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</p>

               <p>On the contrary, the more conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent an Errour is, the more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral alſo is it that it leades from the truth.

ſtraight ſoever that way ſeems to be. Who can reaſonably doubt, but that the Errour of the <hi>Manichees</hi> had been more tolerable, if they had reſted at the belief, that God gave particular marks of his preſence in the body of the Sun, and of the Moon, and that for all that, they had not adored the Sun, nor the Moon; or, that thoſe that by Errour ſhould believe, that there were ſome Divinity in Images, but yet would not adore them, not believing that the Deity would be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ored in the Images, were not leſs Idolaters, or leſs faulty, than thoſe, in whom the motions of the heart, did follow the Errour of the mind.</p>

               <p>Behold here what the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> puts in the place of it; <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>being really preſent in the Sacrament, the grace and bleſſing is not tyed unto the ſenſible forms but unto the proper ſubſtance of his fleſh, which is living and quickning, becauſe of the Divinity which is united unto it. Therefore it is, that all thoſe who believe the Reality, ought not to be troubled to communicate under one kind onely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they thereby receive all that is eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to this Sacrament, with a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſo much the more certain, in that the
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:37449:181"/>
ſeparation of the body and bloud not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing real, as it hath been ſaid, there is received intirely and without diviſion, him that onely is able to ſatisfie us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We need onely to obſerve at the firſt view, how theſe expreſſions are wrapped up, to diſcern how wide this Doctrine is from the ſimplicity of the Goſpel; the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> would ſay, in a word, that the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is not without the bloud, and that he that believes he receives the body, ought to believe that he receives the bloud alſo, under one and the ſame form, by reaſon of what they call <hi>concomitance,</hi> that is to ſay, that the bloud doth accompany the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
               <p>But, in the firſt place, this is conſtantly to ſuppoſe what is in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, to wit, that the body of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is really under the form of bread, and by conſequence, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which we have againſt the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Real preſence, do di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly oppoſe this particular doctrine of taking away the Cup.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Who hath given this right to
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:37449:182"/>
the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, to ſeek for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to take away ſo conſiderable a part of the Inſtitution of our Lord?</p>
               <p n="3">3. And to conclude, what ground hath the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude as he doth, that the ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the body and bloud is not real; for our Lord doth ſeparate them in the Inſtitution; he ſaith of the bread apart, that it is his body broken for us; and of the wine apart, that it is his bloud ſhed for us: and he alſo commands ſeverally that we eat of the bread, and drink of the Cup. The Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> ſaith, without any more ado, that the ſeparation of the body and bloud is not real, and if any would know how he proves it, he adds coldly,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>pa.</hi> 132.</note> 
                  <hi>as it was ſaid.</hi> That is elſewhere, (upon occaſion then alſo) he inſinuated by the way that this ſeparation is myſtical and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurative, without giving the leaſt reaſon for it, any more than he doth here; and it is enough according to him, to make this ſeparation not to be real, that he inſinuate it, without more ado, with an <hi>as it hath been ſaid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="347" facs="tcp:37449:182"/>Nevertheleſs, if the bread and wine be really made the body and bloud of our Lord, according to the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> by what reaſon can one part of the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution be taken to be real, and the other part pretended to be myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and figurative? Or rather, if the ſeparation of the body and bloud be onely in the myſtery and figure, wherefore will they not alſo grant, that the bread and the wine alſo is but the myſtery and the figure of the body and bloud of Jeſus Chriſt? for there is no more reaſon for the one, than for the other. Our Saviour hath ſaid <hi>this is my body which was broken for you;</hi> if theſe words <hi>this is my body,</hi> ought to be underſtood in a proper and real ſenſe, there cannot any good reaſon be given, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe other words that follow, to wit, <hi>which is broken for you,</hi> ought not alſo be taken in the ſame ſenſe as thoſe that went before: but that the firſt, ſhould be underſtood in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſenſe, and they that follow in a
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:37449:183"/>
myſtical and figurative ſenſe is unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable. For as our Saviour ſaid that the bread is his body, he ſaith that this body is broken; it is the ſame Lord ſpeaks: that is in a word, if it muſt be underſtood that the bread is really made the body of Jeſus Chriſt, it cannot be underſtood but that it is alſo made his body really broken, I mean his dead body, and his body really ſeparated from his bloud. So that what way ſoever we take the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> it manifeſtly contradicts it ſelf: for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the bread is not really the body of Jeſus Chriſt; or if it be his body, it is his body broken, and in a ſtate of death; which cannot be ſaid with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out impiety, becauſe our Lord is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen from the dead, and <hi>death hath no more dominion over him.</hi> And Laſtly, ſuppoſe that his proper body were in the Sacrament, in a ſtate of death, and ſeparate from his bloud, this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration being real, it could not be ſaid, as ſaith the Biſhop of <hi>Condom, that the Sacrament is received fully, and without diviſion, under one kind onely;</hi>
                  <pb n="349" facs="tcp:37449:183"/>
nor by conſequence that the Cup ought to be taken away.</p>
               <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> not being able to juſtifie this retrenchment, uſes two reaſons to endeavour to make it indureable. The firſt is, that it is not at all through contempt, that the Church reduces the Faithful to one kind onely; but on the contrary, that it is to hinder the irreverencies, that the confuſion and negligence of the people had cauſed in the laſt Ages, reſerving unto her ſelf the re-eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Communion under both kinds, according as it ſhould be moſt uſeful for increaſing of peace and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>But is not this in ſome ſort to ſay, that our Saviour did not foreſee theſe Irreverencies, when he commanded we ſhould all drink of the Cup; or, that foreſeeing them, he was ſo far from preventing them, that he au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſed them by this Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Theſe Irreverencies were much more to be feared in the Apoſtles times, and in the firſt Ages of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:37449:184"/>
than in the time when this innovation was made: for in the firſt times, the Chriſtians were perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they communicated as they could from houſe to houſe, and communicated at the holding the Feaſts which they called Feaſts of Charity. The Apoſtle complains of diſorders committed in thoſe Feaſts, ſaying,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.20.</note> 
                  <hi>that was not to eat the Supper of the Lord,</hi> and yet the Apoſtle ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thought of taking away the Cup becauſe of theſe Irreverencies.</p>
               <p>They muſt be very much prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, who ſee not the true reaſon why neither Jeſus Chriſt, nor the Apoſtle, nor the Church during the ſpace of above a thouſand years, ever thought of taking away the Cup, and that yet the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at laſt be thought her ſelf to take it away.</p>
               <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> gives this reaſon himſelf unawares: in effect, ſaith he, the taking away the Cup, or the communion under one kind, is a conſequence of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation. Before Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation was believed, there was a
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:37449:184"/>
great regard had for the Sacraments of the body and bloud of Jeſus Chriſt: but the Irreverencies were not of the ſame conſequence, nor ſo ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous as they have been, ſince it was caught that the bread and the wine are no longer the ſame which they are ſeen to be, but that they are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per body, and the proper bloud of Jeſus Chriſt; for it is well known, that it is onely ſince Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath paſſed into an Article of Faith, that the Cup alſo hath been taken away.</p>
               <p>Therefore alſo whatever hopes the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> ſeems to give, that the Communion under the Form of the wine may be re-eſtabliſht for the benefit of peace and re-union, in all appearance we are to a wait a long time this re-eſtabliſhment, if it be at all to be expected, whilſt the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Tranſubſtantiation ſhall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt. The benefit of re-union, which hinderd not but that the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> did elude this re-eſtabliſhment in a time, when it was demanded with ſo much inſtance, will never in all
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:37449:185"/>
likelihood prevail againſt the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of Irreverencie, which will alwayes continue: that is to ſay, it will alwayes be a great ſcandal, ever and anon to ſee ſpilt that which is believed to be the proper bloud of the Lord; and the ſimple reflexion which may be made on this conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, may alone be capable to open at laſt the eyes of the people upon the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it ſelf.</p>
               <p>The other conſideration which the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> brings for the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away the Cup, is this, that he ſaith our own Synods have not judged that in the Lords Supper we ought to deny the bread unto thoſe, who "by a natural averſion, cannot ſuffer "the ſmell or taſte of wine; and that by conſequence, the communion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der both kinds is not eſſential unto the Sacrament, and that it is in the power of the Church, to give therein onely one.</p>
               <p>But who ſees not the extreme diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that there is betwixt this uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of our Churches, and that which
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:37449:185"/>
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ordains and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes, and that there can no good conſequence be drawn from the one unto the other? Our Synods are ſo far from allowing to themſelves the authority of taking away any thing from the Inſtitution of our Saviour, or of making any the leaſt change therein, that they have kept them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo religiouſly to his words, as to have made it a queſtion, whether the bread ſhould be given unto them who onely through this natural averſion, which they cannot over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, forbear to take the ſign of the wine; and they give not the bread it ſelf, but in the manner which the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> reports, cauſing them who cannot drink wine to make a proteſtation, that it is not through diſreſpect, and obliging them to put the Cup to their lips to avoid ſcandal.</p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, takes away the Cup from whole Nations, that deſire it, reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aving his advantage to the Clergy lone, or to Princes, or other con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſiderable

                     <hi>pa.</hi> 158.</note> 
                  <hi>the unwritten Word was the firſt rule of Chriſtianity, and when thereto the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:37449:189"/>
of the New Teſtament were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, this Word did not thereby loſe its authority.</hi> We muſt obſerve here at firſt, that this is to ſpeak in ſome ſort improperly to ſay, that Jeſus Chriſt founded the Church <hi>upon preaching</hi> and not rather by preaching: Preaching is a means, and not a foundation: the means may ceaſe, the foundation ought to be durable. And, no more is it true, that the unwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Word was the firſt rule of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity: It is the Scripture it ſelf of the Old Teſtament, which was the firſt, and the eldeſt rule, and the foundation of the Faith of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. It is the Old Teſtament, that not onely contains the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Law, which is the permanent and unchangeable rule of our Duty, as well towards God, as towards men, but likewiſe all the figures, all the promiſes, and all the propheſies touching the Meſſias, the time, and the place of his Birth, and all the circumſtances of his death. The Goſpel, as all the world knows, is not the abrogating, but the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:37449:189"/>
of the Law; therefore it is, that we ſee that Jeſus Chriſt and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, grounded their preaching upon the Scriptures of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament.

               <p>It is beſides a very improper man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſpeaking, to ſay, <hi>that when the Scriptures of the New Teſtament
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:37449:190"/>
were joyned unto the unwritten Word, this word for all that did not thereby loſe its authority;</hi> as if the Doctrine of the Goſpel, ſuch as we have it now in writing, were an acceſſary, or were a thing different from that unto which they pretend it was join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; or that that which was not written were more conſiderable, than that which we have in the Sacred Books: for this expreſſion of the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi>'s, that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures were joyned to the unwritten word, ſuggeſts all theſe imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in ſtead of ſaying the thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly as it is. He ſhould have ſaid, that the unwritten Word having been put into writing, or the Scripture of the New Teſtament having ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded preaching, this Divine Word not onely not loſt its authority, but on the contrary was corroborated, in that it doth not any longer depend on the memory, nor the will of men naturally ſubject unto Errour.</p>
               <p>For upon the main, the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> pretends, that the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture contains onely the leſſer part of
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:37449:190"/>
Chriſtian Religion; and that on the contrary, Tradition doth contain the principal part. At leaſt his pretence is, that there may be ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Doctrines which are not to be had but by Tradition, which ought not for their not being in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture therefore to loſe their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
               <p>As for any thing elſe, the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are ſo little firm to their principle of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, or at leaſt they ſo well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that Tradition cannot go equal with Scripture, though the Council hath been pleaſed to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the contrary, that when they are preſſed touching particular Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, which are in queſtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them and us, there is ſcarce one, but they endeavour to ſupport by the authority of Scripture, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be by interpreting it in their ſenſe, or by the conſequences which they draw thence. When they treat of Tradition in general, they maintain it with exceſs, comparing it to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, as if it went through all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:37449:191"/>
and when they treat of their Doctrines in particular, they would make the World believe, that there is ſcarce any one amongſt them, which is not founded on the very Scripture.</p>
               <p>But if we would know neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, how the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> proves, that the particular ponits of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition are the very Doctrine of the Apoſtles, unwritten, it may be at firſt we would believe, that he had in hand ſome Authour either of the age of the Apoſtles themſelves, or at leaſt of the following age, which ſpeaketh clearly and in expreſs words, we have received ſuch or ſuch a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine from the mouth of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; or we hold it from thoſe who have received it themſelves from the Apoſtles own mouth: for who can doubt, but that there ſhould be at leaſt ſome formal and expreſs Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, to eſtabliſh by the ſole autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Tradition, a Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, or any Important Doctrine, that ſhould binde mens Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="363" facs="tcp:37449:191"/>But in concluſion, behold here what the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> gives us in ſtead of ſuch a proof:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>pa.</hi> 159, 160.</note> 
                  <hi>the certain ſign</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that a Tradition comes from the Apoſtles, is, when it is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced by all the Chriſtian Churches, without poſſible finding out the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it,</hi> &amp;c. And a little after, <hi>It not being poſſible,</hi> adds he, <hi>that a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine received from the beginning of the Church, can proceed from any other origin, but that of the Apoſtles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> indefinitely layes down this Maxim, not daring to apply the ſame unto any of the Traditions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as knowing that this character, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite as it is, doth not ſuit with them.</p>
               <p>To judge rightly of his argument, and of the conſequence which he would draw from thence, this is the order into which we ought to put his propoſitions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is impoſſible,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that a Doctrine received from the beginning of the Church, ſhould proceed from any other origin but from the Apoſtles; A
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:37449:192"/>
Doctrine embraced by all the Chriſtian Churches, whereof the beginning cannot be ſhewed, is neceſſarily from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Church: Therefore ſuch a Doctrine proceeds from the Apoſtles.</hi> Now <hi>the Traditions of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>are Doctrines embraced by all the Chriſtian Churches, without poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of ſhewing their beginning; therefore, they proceed from the Apoſtles.</hi> Theſe are the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi>'s propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in the order wherein they ought to be: and in this order it is plainly evident, that there is not one of them that is abſolutely true, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that is not falſe, in the terms in which it is conceived.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, this propoſition is not true, that it is not poſſible that a Doctrine received from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But the ſecond propoſition is yet leſs true, that a Doctrine embraced by all the Chriſtian Churches, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the beginning is not to be found, ſhould neceſſarily be from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Church, or that it ſhould come from the Apoſtles, which is the ſame thing in the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi>'s ſenſe; for thoſe that make any refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion upon the manner by which changes come in, either in the Laws or Cuſtoms of States, or in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Doctrines of Religion, very well know, that the time and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of theſe changes cannot always be ſhewn.

Who could ſhew the Original of all the falſe Traditions of the <hi>Jewes?</hi> Should it therefore be ſaid, that they were all from the beginning of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, or the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written Word of <hi>Moſes?</hi> Amongſt Chriſtians themſelves, for example, the uſe of giving the Sacrament unto little children, was without doubt generally obſerved,<note place="margin">De pec. in rit. &amp; remi. ii. <hi>1.</hi> ca. <hi>20,</hi> &amp; <hi>24.</hi> Et l. <hi>3.</hi> contr: Julian: c: <hi>4:</hi> S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In fine, the third propoſition
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:37449:193"/>
which the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> doth ſuppoſe in his Argument, is yet leſs true than the two former, namely that the Traditions of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> which ſeparate us from her communion, are Doctrines embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by all the Chriſtian Churches, without poſſible ſhewing the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thereof. Can the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhew any thing near this, of any one of thoſe Traditions which are in diſpute betwixt us? for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, of Purgatory, of the invocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Saints, of worſhipping of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, of Relicks, of the Croſs, of auricular confeſſion, of Indulgences, of the Pope's Supremacy, of private Maſſes, of the adoration of the Hoſt, of the communion under one kind, of religious Worſhip in an unknown Tongue; or in fine, of any of the particular Doctrines which ſeparate us from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church? For not to ſpeak of the preſent time in which it is evidently known, that there are many of the Chriſtian Churches, as well in the Eaſt as the Weſt, which do not embrace all the Doctrines of
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:37449:194"/>
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> it is alſo a thing moſt certain and notorious, that it is not in the power of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to ſhew, I will not ſay of all theſe Doctrines in general, but of any one of them alone, that it was embraced, not onely in all times, but ſcarcely at any time, by all the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Churches.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, there are a great number of theſe Traditions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> whereof their firſt beginnings may preciſely enough be ſhewn: for example, the worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of Saints and Images, auricular confeſſion, the communion under one kind, and many others: and of all in general, excepting that of praying for the dead, whereof there is ſome mention to be found towards the latter end of the ſecond Age.

               <p>Behold therefore the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi>'s argument overthrown in all its parts, ſeeing that the Maxime which he layes down is not true, (which is, that all the Doctrines, embraced by all the Chriſtian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, whereof the firſt beginning cannot be ſhewn, proceed from the Apoſtles) and that the application which he doth make is leſs true, which is, that all the Traditions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are Doctrines embrac'd by all the Chriſtian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, without poſſibility of ſhewing their beginning and by conſequence this concluſion, whether it be of the Biſhop of <hi>Condom,</hi> or of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> far from being true and orthodox, is a very ſtrange princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>that we ought to receive the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> (even thoſe which do ſeparate

The Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> doth not clearly explain wherein this authority conſiſts; nor what he underſtands by the Church, which ſhould have this authority; whether this authority ſhould have any bounds, or whether it ſhould have none, or whether it be the Pope with the Council, or without the Council, or the Council alone, in which this authority doth reſide; for we alſo have our Churches, and our Governours, and we believe that we ſhould not onely keep order, but all that doth conduce for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of unity and concord; and the Queſtion here as elſewhere, is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes but of the more or leſs.</p>
               <p>What the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> ſayes in this caſe, is reducible to four prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal propoſitions. The firſt, <q>that it cannot be, but by the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church, that we receive the whole body of the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</q>
                  <pb n="371" facs="tcp:37449:195"/>
The ſecond, <q>that it is of the Church, that we learn Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and by Tradition the true ſenſe of the Scriptures. The third, that it is the Church, and her Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours aſſembled, which ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine controverſies that divide the Faithful, and that when once they have reſolved any matter, we ought to ſubmit unto their deciſions, without examining anew that which they have reſolved. The fourth and laſt, that this authority is ſo neceſſary, that after having denied it, we have been forced to eſtabliſh it amongſt us by our diſcipline, by the Acts of our Synods, and by our practice in things pertaining to Faith it ſelf.</q>
               </p>
               <p>As to the firſt, we agree with the Biſhop of <hi>Condom,</hi> that the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church is the Guardian of the Scriptures, and that as ſhe hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Law and the Prophets from the Jewiſh Church, ſo it is from the Chirſtian Church, that the Faithful receive all the Scriptures as well of the Old, as of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="372" facs="tcp:37449:196"/>We even acknowledge that the authority of the Church is a lawful reaſon, which at firſt makes us look upon the Scripture as a revelation from Heaven: but we do deny, not onely that it is meerly by the authority of the Church, but that it is principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by her authority, that we receive the Scripture as the Divine Word.</p>
               <p>The Scripture is full of Teſtimonies which it ſelf gives of its Divinity, and of the efficacious power which it hath upon hearts, by the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>It is indeed ſomewhat injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to this the Divinity of the Scripture, and to its efficacy, and ſomewhat contradictory, when it is contended that a matter Divine ſhould not be received, but by dependance upon an humane authority.</p>
               <p>It is, as if one would ſay, that it is yet at this day onely by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Jewiſh Church, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians have received the whole body of the Scriptures of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe it is by her hand that we have received them; though
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:37449:196"/>
upon the whole, the authority of this peopel, choſen of God, may be a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ground of the Divinity of the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Truth hath its proper character even in humane matters, which makes us acknowledge it for its ſelf, when once it is ſet before our eyes, and not for the authority of thoſe who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it to us: By greater reaſon Heavenly truths, like the Sun, manifeſt themſelves by their proper ſplendour.</p>
               <p>'Tis a common ſpeech upon this ſubject, that a man aſleep, being told the Sun is up, preſently believes it is day, upon what is told him; but when once he ſees it is day, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves it not any longer, becauſe he was told ſo, but becauſe he ſees it; and he doth not ſo much as dream any longer that it was told him ſo.</p>
               <p>The Gentlemen of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will not agree, that it is as clear that the Scripture is the Word of God, as it is clear that it is day, when the Sun is above our Horizon; and this is it, which the Biſhop of
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:37449:197"/>
                  <hi>Condom</hi> gives to underſtand in terms poſitive enough, when he ſpeaks of us, that <hi>whatever we ſay, he believes that it is principally the authority of the Church,</hi>

                  <hi>that determines us to reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence as Divine Books, the Song of Songs,</hi> which hath ſo few ſenſible marks of prophetical inſpiration; the Epiſtle of St. <hi>James,</hi> which <hi>Luther</hi> rejected; and that of St. <hi>Jude,</hi> which might be ſuſpected, by reaſon of ſome Apocryphal Books, which are therein alledged.</p>
               <p>But how dare any man rebate, or decry, as I may ſo ſpeak, the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and force of the Word of God?

               <p>For will any ſay, that, if theſe Writings had not had any character of Divinity, the ſole approbation of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> could give them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>For our parts,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16.</note> we ſay with the Apoſtle, that <hi>all Scripture is given by inſpiration of God:</hi> and if all men do not look upon them in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, or with the ſame ſentiments, it is not the fault of the Scripture, but it is the effect of the variety and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the humane ſpirit, and the wiſe and free diſpenſation of the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, which bloweth where it will, and as it will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>An evident proof, that it is not the authority of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which determines thoſe of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion to reverence the Scriptures, and theſe three Books particularly, as Canonical (but that it is their own proper character, and the grace which we believe that God gives us, to acknowledge this character) is, that
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:37449:198"/>
'tis well known there are ſome others, as <hi>Tobie, Judith, VViſdome, Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticus,</hi> and the two firſt Books of <hi>Maccabees,</hi> &amp;c. which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> receives as Canonical, which we receive not as ſuch: and that on the contrary, we do receive the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of St. <hi>James,</hi> which the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans</hi> receive not, at leaſt all of them as we do, whatever conformity there may be in other things betwixt them and us. Again, as a proof that it is not the authority of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, which determines the one, or the other of us, to receive the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament as Canonical, we may take this, that at this time the <hi>Jewes</hi> not receiving for ſuch, all that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> receiveth, ſhe doth not think her ſelf bound to acquieſce in their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi>'s ſecond propoſition, touching the authority of the Church, depends in a manner wholly on the former; for he ſaith, that as we receive the Scriptures from the hands of the Church, ſo we learn

Tradition of her, and by means of Tradition the true ſenſe of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. In good time: Let the Church then be the Guardian of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as ſhe is of the Scriptures; and let her make uſe of Tradition either for order and diſcipline, to facilitate the underſtanding of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, but let her not make thereof a title, to impoſe upon us Worſhips or Doctrines which do not accord with the Scriptures, or to make the ſenſe of the Scripture to depend ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely upon the interpretation of the Church: as in receiving the Old Teſtament from the <hi>Jewes,</hi> the Church did not tye her ſelf blindly to receive their Traditions which overthrow the Law, nor their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, when it doth not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord with the true ſenſe of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</p>
               <p>Errour, as vice, is for the moſt part in the extremes: we owe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, teachableneſs and ſubmiſſion, unto all thoſe whom God ſets over us to inſtruct us; this is not conteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but this is no reaſon to change
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:37449:199"/>
this ſubmiſſion into a voluntary blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>Faith being a gift of God, we ought not to change, nor force the uſe of the exteriour means which God employes to work it in our hearts; but we ought to uſe them according to his intention, with a ſpirit of ſweetneſs and of charity, to perſwade and not to conſtrain. Otherwiſe, a blind ſubmiſſion in matter of Faith, is not ſubmiſſion, but a ſpirit of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude, very unworthy of the liberty of the children of God; and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſuch a ſubmiſſion, by what name ſoever it be called, is to make an outward ſociety, of bodies, of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and appearance, and not at all a true communion of ſpirit, and of judgement.<note place="margin">

                  <hi>The Church,</hi> ſaith the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Condom, doth profeſs that ſhe ſaith nothing now of her ſelf, that ſhe inventeth not any thing anew in points of Doctrine:</hi> and elſewhere, <hi>very far from intending to render her ſelf miſtriſs of her Faith, as her Adverſaries accuſe her, ſhe hath done what ſhe can to bind her ſelf, and that the means of innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:37449:199"/>
may be taken away, ſeeing ſhe not onely ſubmits to the Scripture, but to baniſh for ever thoſe arbitrary interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which make mens thoughts to paſs for Scripture, ſhe hath bound her ſelf to underſtand them, as to what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards Faith and manners, according to the ſenſe of the holy Fathers, from which ſhe profeſſeth never to depart; declaring in all the Councils, and in all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of Faith, which ſhe hath pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, that ſhe receives not any Doctrine which is not conformable unto the tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the foregoing Ages.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> doth well to ſay, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> profeſſes that ſhe invents not any thing; for where be the Innovatours which do not profeſs the ſame thing? But upon the main, is it true that the latter Councils have alwayes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly followed the Doctrine of the Fathers, or of the very preceding Councils? for not to ſpeak of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, of worſhipping the Hoſte, and of private Maſſes, which according to us are Doctrines and Worſhips unknown, at leaſt in the
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:37449:200"/>
eight firſt Ages (becauſe the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church do not agree to it) it hath already been made appear in another place, that the worſhipping of Images was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by the Councils of <hi>Eliberis,</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and of <hi>Francfort,</hi> and that the ſame Worſhip has been eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed or maintained by the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ſecond Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and in the laſt place by that of <hi>Trent.</hi> It bath alſo been ſhewed upon the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Purgatory, that that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, with all its conſequences, was put in the place of the opinion which many of the Fathers of the firſt Ages had, that after death the ſouls did ſleep, or did refreſh themſelves in a place ſeparate from Heaven. The caſe is the ſame as to Auricular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſſion, and of Indulgences, which have ſucceeded to the practice of publick pennance, and generally as to all the Doctrines, and all the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, of which we find no foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps in the Fathers of the three firſt Ages, nor in the firſt Councils, and which we pretend to have been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:37449:200"/>
at ſeveral times unto the Doctrine and Inſtitution of Jeſus Chriſt, and of his Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>And here to inſtance yet in two examples of alteration in Doctrine and practice, which are quite out of all queſtion: Hath not the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> (which is that the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> takes for the rule of his Expoſition) abrogated the doctrine and uſe of giving the Sacrament unto little children, of which we have already ſpoken? Hath it not alſo declared in expreſs terms, for confirming the taking away the cup, which was before ordained by the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> that therein little weight could be laid on the Fathers; for it is to no purpoſe (ſo the Council decides) to alledge the ſixth of St. <hi>John</hi> for the communion under both kinds,<note place="margin">Seſs. <hi>21.</hi> de com. cap. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>what way ſoever</hi> (ſaith the Council) <hi>it be underſtood, according to the ſundry interpretations of the holy Fathers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We will not here examine, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all theſe divers changes are for the better or worſe, becauſe it hath
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:37449:201"/>
been already done heretofore, and becauſe we treat not here of the right, but onely of the matter of fact, which the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> hath averred, to wit, <hi>that the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>hath bound her ſelf, that ſhe hath taken away the means of innovating, that ſhe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits her ſelf through all to the ſenſe of the Holy Fathers, and that ſhe doth not receive any Doctrine which is not conformable unto that of precedent A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude, theſe Expoſitions ſeem to intimate, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not ſo well aſſured of her infallibility, but that it hath been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged ſhe had need to be ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red againſt her ſelf, by tying up her hands, and taking away the means of Innovation. And nevertheleſs, if we will be a little informed by themſelves, what hath been the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of all this precaution? Let the Doctrines of the laſt five or ſix cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies, be onely compared in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral with the Doctrines and practices of the three firſt, and even with the following Ages; the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi>
                  <pb n="383" facs="tcp:37449:201"/>
with them that went before it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having any regard, if they pleaſe, to our diſputes. It will eaſily appear, whether the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath hath kept her ſelf within the bounds, which it is ſaid that ſhe hath preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed her ſelf; if ſhe hath always exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly followed the ſteps of thoſe, which went before her; and if in fine, what is here ſaid of her temper and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, be not onely rather the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſtile of thoſe who make profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſubmitting themſelves unto Laws, even when they openly tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple them under foot.</p>
               <p>The third propoſition particularly regards the authority and infallibility of Synods, or Councils. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> ſaith, that it is the part of Paſtours aſſembled to decide controverſies, and the Faithful to receive their deciſions without exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining them: we all agree to the former part of this propoſition; and we believe alſo that the way of Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal Aſſemblies, is the moſt univerſal outward means, and the moſt effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, that God makes uſe of, to
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:37449:202"/>
keep mens minds united in one onely Belief.</p>
               <p>But as we cannot agree to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> attributes unto them, ſo neither can we accord, that the Faithful are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged blindly to receive their deciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons without examining them.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>John</hi> 5.39. <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.15. <hi>Acts</hi> 20.29. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.21. <hi>Act.</hi> 17.11.</note> The Apoſtles themſelves did not demand ſo blind a ſubmiſſion to their own Doctrine: on the contrary, they adviſed that men would compare it with the Scripture, that they would diſtinguiſh the Wolf from the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd; that they would examine all, and retain that which was good: and thoſe of <hi>Berea</hi> were commended, for that after having heard the Apoſtles, they compared their Sermons with the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid that this might take place as to the Doctrine of each Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in particular, and not as to what had been decided by all the Apoſtles, as that which the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> alledgeth out of the 15th. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> when the Apoſtles being aſſembled upon the controverſie which was rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:37449:202"/>
touching the ceremonies of the Law, they pronounced theſe remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable works, <hi>It ſeemed good unto the Holy Ghoſt and to us,</hi> &amp;c. And that afterwards, <hi>St.</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Silas <hi>went through the Cities, teaching believers to keep the Ordinances of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the firſt place, the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> would do well to put ſome difference betwixt thoſe holy men, which had received the Holy Ghoſt immediately, in form of fiery tongues, and the Fathers of the latter Councils, of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> and of <hi>Trent;</hi> of whom the very <hi>Romiſh</hi> Catholick Authours obſerve the paſſion, the motives, and the humane intereſt, that inſpirited them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We ſee, that though the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were fully perſwaded of their authority, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of himſelf, yet they are very far from thundring out <hi>Anathema</hi>'s for the leaſt matters, as the Council hath done, at every word, againſt all thoſe that will not admit even of meer School-diſtinctions, and Figures
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:37449:203"/>
of Rhetorick. We ſee the Apoſtles found their judgment upon the Holy Scriptures, and having concluded upon it, they onely ſay with the greateſt ſweetneſs in the World, <hi>If you do theſe things you will do well.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Nor were they at all concerned even in this diſpute, about eſſential points of Faith, but onely about cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Law, which were alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſilently abrogated by the Goſpel, &amp; which the Apoſtles would maintain but for a time, to give the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue an honourable burial, and to maintain union betwixt the Jewes, and the other people which had new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly embraced the Doctrine of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. In ſumme, very ſoon after, St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf preached, that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might eat indifferently of all ſorts of meat; and it is known, that in proceſs of time, the uſage eſtabliſhed by this Ordinance of the Apoſtles was inſenſibly aboliſhed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It doth not appear, that the Apoſtles did publiſh their deciſion with an abſolute injunction to obey it: but they ſent <hi>Paul, Barnabas,</hi>
                  <pb n="387" facs="tcp:37449:203"/>
and <hi>Silas,</hi> to inſtruct the Faithful to keep this Ordinance; that is to ſay, in all likelihood, to ſhew them the motives and grounds thereof: which doth not import, that it was forbid them to examine it.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, we may retort againſt the Gentlemen of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, what the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> afterwards objects againſt us, which is, that their practice agrees not at all with their Maxims: for it is not true, that they believe the Councils to be infallible in all things, nor that they alwayes receive all their deciſions, either with examining them, or without examining them. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, they have not held to thoſe of the Councils, whereof we have ſpoken, which forbad the worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of Images; and the deciſions of thoſe Councils have not hindred, but that other Councils have ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the contrary. It is known, that the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church hath not yet, to this day, received all the deciſions of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> as to points that regard Eccleſiaſtical Order and
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:37449:204"/>
diſcipline, which notwithſtanding are much more of humane Juriſdiction, than the very matters of Faith.</p>
               <p>The fourth and laſt propoſition of the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi>'s touching the authority of the Church, is, that wherein he objects againſt us, that this authority is ſo neceſſary, that after having decried it, we have been obliged to eſtabliſh it in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry matters of Faith it ſelf.</p>
               <p>This propoſition contains two ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations which deſtroy each the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that which makes them the leſs credible. The one is, that we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryed the authority of the Church; the other, that we have eſtabliſhed it without any bounds. In ſumme, nothing is worſe grounded than the firſt of theſe accuſations: for it is not true, that we ever denyed that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſhould be obſerved in the Church, nor that we have ever written or ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken againſt the juſt authority of thoſe whom God calls to be Paſtours and Governours of the Faithful.

In fine, we could have again exclaimed againſt
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:37449:205"/>
the abuſe of Indulgences; and in a word, againſt all thoſe points, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the manner of the Government of the Church is become ſo widely dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from that, wherein it was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the Apoſtles and St. <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf, of whom the Popes ſtyle themſelves ſucceſſours; but in all theſe very things, thoſe of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion are the onely perſons, nay the firſt, that have neither ſpoken nor written, nor again and again exclaimed againſt the abuſes and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes of the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Liberties of the <hi>Gallicane</hi> Church, the quarrels of our Kings with the Popes, the concordates, the Remonſtrances of Biſhops, the Acts of Parliaments, the decrees of the Colledge of <hi>Sorbon,</hi> the appeals un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Councils, Finally, the Writings of a great number of Catholicks, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in theſe laſt times, clearly enough ſhew, that we are not the onely men, nor the firſt, nor the laſt, which have cryed down the exceſſive authority of Popes.</p>
               <p>Let us proceed now to the ſecond
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:37449:205"/>
accuſation, which is, that after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving decryed this authority, we have been conſtrained to eſtabliſh it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt our ſelves. We have no mind to ſay, that there is not any Order eſtabliſhed amongſt us; but the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop pretends, that we give this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility &amp; authority unto our Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, which we will not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, neither in the perſons of Popes, nor in the Aſſemblies of Councils: and he means the ſame afterwards, that we have given it even to exceſs, and with a kind of abandoning our right. To this purpoſe, he reports, in the firſt place an Act of the Synod at <hi>Charenton</hi> in 1644. upon the caſe of thoſe who were called Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants. Secondly, an Article of our diſcipline in the title of Conſiſtories. Thirdly, the Form of Letters Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, which are given to thoſe who are deputed to go to the Synods, which was drawn up a the Synod held at <hi>Vitre</hi> in 1617. Fourthly and Laſtly, a reſolution that was taken at the Synod of St. <hi>Faith</hi> in 1578, upon occaſion of an overture of accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:37449:206"/>
which was propoſed betwixt thoſe of our communion, and thoſe of the confeſſion of <hi>Ausburg,</hi> which are called <hi>Lutherans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is yet another paſſage of the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi>'s Treatiſe, wherein he uſeth his utmoſt endeavours, and where he hopes to finde the greateſt advantage. When he treats of his own belief, that is ſoon paſſed over; he ſaith but a word, in clouded terms, he ſcarce proves any thing, and makes himſelf no objection; and if haply it be taken notice of, that he uſeth to do ſo, he will ſay, that it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he makes onely a bare expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that he hath propoſed to himſelf, neither to ſpeak all, nor to prove what he ſpeaks. But when once or twice he is come unto ſome points of thoſe of Chriſtian Religion, where there ſeems to be ſome diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in our doctrine, as well as in that of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> then it is that he diſplayes all the ſubtilty of his arguring; then it is that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larges and inſults over us, as if we onely could hang down our
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:37449:206"/>
heads. This is the part of a fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Enemy, which keeps himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed, and onely makes ſome ſmall ſally at certain times.</p>
               <p>The firſt difficulty which the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> here creates us, is no difficulty: The Synod in 1644. doth cenſure the Independants, becauſe they would not acknowledge the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Aſſemblies and Synods, and it gives the ſame reaſon which is cited by the Biſhop of <hi>Condom, that this proceeding is ſo prejudicial to the State, as well as to the Church, that it opens the door unto Irregularities and extravagancies, that it takes away the means of remedy, and that in fine if it might have place, it would produce as many Religions, as there are pariſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s, or particular Aſſemblies.</hi> This plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imports, that in the communion of our Churches, we love Order, and that we acknowledge the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Aſſemblies, and Synods, as a means conform to the practice eſtabliſhed by our Saviour, and by the Apoſtles, and very proper to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the purity of Faith, and to
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:37449:207"/>
maintain unity. But this implies not any wiſe, that we have attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a kind of infallibility, or a ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign and abſolute authority unto our Synods, ſuch as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> attributes unto Popes, and unto Councils, which is the onely thing in queſtion. It is as if one ſhould ſay, that in acknowledging the juſt authority of Magiſtrates, for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of Laws, and the ſervice of the Prince, we did allow, that the Magiſtrates are above the Laws, or have right to give what Orders they pleaſe, how contrary ſoever thoſe Orders may appear to be againſt the ſervice of the common Maſter, ſo that at no time, and in no caſe, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might forbear the obſervance of theſe Orders, to continue faithful unto their Soveraign.</p>
               <p>The Independants fault was not, in that they admitted of nothing but the Word of God to be a rule of Faith: they did not abſolutely reject Synods themſelves; for afterwards in 1653. they held an Aſſembly nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous enough in <hi>London,</hi> where they
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:37449:207"/>
compoſed their confeſſion of Faith. Their fault was chiefly in this regard, in that they would not ſubmit to have amongſt them a conſtant and perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent rule of having conferences and Synods, whereby they kept the door open unto all ſorts of confuſion, as well in State as Church, voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depriving themſelves of one of the beſt outward means, which God hath given to men, to prevent corruption and Schiſms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But,</hi> ſaith the Biſhop of <hi>Condom, it is principally in matter of Faith, that the Synod would eſtabliſh a dependance, inaſmuch as the greateſt inconveniency that it obſerves, whereinto the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful might fall by independency, is this very point, that Schiſms might be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, or as many Religions ariſe, as there were pariſhes.</hi> But if this conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence were good, it might alſo be ſaid, that Faith and Religion do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on the civil Magiſtrate, becauſe if the people were not reſtrained by the authority of the Magiſtrate, they would live each according to their own fancy, even in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:37449:208"/>
it ſelf. Faith and diſcipline mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually hold hands: Faith works a love of order and diſcipline; order and diſcipline ſerve to keep up the purity of Faith. But they are, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, things very different; and it cannot be ſaid for all this, that Faith depends upon order, or upon the Orderers, whether they be civil or Eccleſiaſtical.</p>
               <p>To conclude, we do not at all deny, but that even in matters of Faith, we ought to depend upon the guidance of Synods and of Paſtours: on the contrary, we do recommend teachableneſs, deference, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; the Queſtion even here is, but of the more or leſs. The point in hand is to know, whether the Popes or Councils be infallible, and by conſequence, whether we ought to depend blindly on their power, ſo that at no time, nor in any caſe, we may refuſe to ſubmit to their Bulls, and to their Decrees: and we have made evident, that there have been many times and occaſions, upon which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> her ſelf
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:37449:208"/>
hath not wholly received all the Bulls, nor all the Decrees of Popes or of Councils.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing that the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> objects againſt us in this caſe is, that Article of our Diſcipline, where it is ſaid, <hi>that the Conſiſtories ſhould endeavour to appeaſe the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which may ariſe upon any point of Doctrine and Diſcipline; and that in caſe of appeal unto a National Synod, the full and final reſolution ſhould be there made by the Word of God, unto which if the Gainſayers ſhould refuſe to acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſce from point to point, with an expreſs diſowning of their errours, they ſhould be cut off from the Church.</hi> From whence the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> draws this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, that we do not attribute the authority of this laſt judgment to the Word of God taken in it ſelf, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependently upon the interpretation of the Church, becauſe the appeal of indifferent perſons was received, who had in their judgment applied that very word.</p>
               <p>The difficulty is here onely as it may be ſeen, upon the more or leſs
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:37449:209"/>
of the authority which ſhould be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed unto the judgment of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, or of Popes, and of Councils. Neither this rule, nor the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence which the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> draws from it, ſpeak any thing but what we have already all along ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, that order and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance is requiſite, and that Paſtours and Synods are appointed to govern the Church, to teach the Word of God, and to promote the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of it. But this infers not at all, that we attribute infallibility unto our Paſtours, nor to our Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth to Popes, and Councils; nor that the people are obliged to receive their deciſions without examining them, or to give a blind obedience unto them The Article ſayes, that thoſe who have any ſcruple ſhall be heard in the Synod <hi>with all holy freedom,</hi> and that the ſcruple or difficulty ſhall be there reſolved by the Word of God. It is not poſſible to find a temper more juſt and equitable to retain, on the one ſide particular perſons in a juſt
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:37449:209"/>
moderation, and to leave to God and his Word the ſupreme and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute authority over our conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>It may be, that this moderation it ſelf is not without ſome inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and that it would ſeem, that the opinion of the infallibility of Popes, or of Councils, and the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign and abſolute authority that is attributed unto them, are as a ſtrong rampire to retain the people within bounds.</p>
               <p>But, in the firſt place, an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience in a Government is no ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient reaſon, that another ſhould be good and juſt, if it be not ſo of it ſelf. 2. Where is there any order and form of Government either in Church or State, but that there is ſome inconvenience? There is much more without compariſon, in attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting infallibility and an abſolute dominion unto Popes, and to Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, becauſe when it ſo happens, that Popes or Councils fall into any errour, as it ought to be ſuppoſed in this part of the Queſtion that it may
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:37449:210"/>
ſo happen, and as we are convinced by experience that it hath happened diverſetimes, the evil is almoſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out remedy. Errour hath the force of authentick and irrevocable Law, it renders it ſelf more general, more durable, and by conſequence more difficult to be reformed; and when once the guides are blind, then there will be a neceſſity to fly to particular perſons, unto whom God giveth ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient light, ſtrength, and courage to take the part of the Truth. But that it might not be ſaid, that this is onely a ſuppoſition accommodated unto the particular caſe of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Fathers, it is known, how hard it was to root out <hi>Arria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm,</hi> when it was ſupported by the authority of the Epiſcopal chair of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of the Council of <hi>Arimini;</hi> that it is principally unto the zeal and courage of St. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> that the glory of reſtoring Chriſtianity in its purity is due, and that in fine, if God had not made uſe of this holy man, and of others that ſeconded him, the <hi>Arrians</hi> might have fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:37449:210"/>
themſelues, ſo that they might have maſtered the Councils, and Truth might have groaned longer than it did, under the oppreſſion of thoſe Hereticks.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In fine, it is not abſolutely true neither upon the whole, that the infallibility and authority which is attributed to Popes and Councils, is either a ſtronger or a ſurer means to reſtrain the people, than is the temperament of our Diſcipline. For experience ſhews, that for more than an Age, ſince our Churches of <hi>France</hi> have been governed by this order, there hath never been any difference amongſt us, either in doctrine or in diſcipline, which hath not been decided without any trouble; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it might be ſaid, that the exceſſive authority of Popes and of Councils, far from hindring of diviſion, hath very much contributed unto the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions of the Eaſt againſt the Weſt, and of the Weſt againſt it ſelf; which are the two Schiſms, the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable and unfortunate that could fall out in the Church. The ſincere
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:37449:211"/>
perſons of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge yet to this day, that it is the too great heighth with which the Popes, and the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> did affect to make Articles of Faith of all that was diſputed in the very Schools, and to anathematize thoſe that would not receive thoſe Do<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ctrines, that hath put an obſtruction well nigh inuincible to the peace and re-union of Chriſtians. And not long ſince again, amongſt <hi>Roman</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, we have ſeen that the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Popes ſupported by that of Princes, has ſcarce been able in ſome way to hinder, that the differences which had ſtirred up ſo much eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon points of Doctrine and Diſcipline, had not cauſed yet great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſcandal. But after all we daily ſee, that this authority of the Pope hath onely the power to change the outward appearances, but the unity of minds is wanting: ſo true is it, that it is onely the knowledge of Faith and charity, which are the ſolid grounds of an holy union of hearts, and of thoughts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="403" facs="tcp:37449:211"/>The Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> doth yet make a third difficulty, upon the form of the Letters, which we give unto our Deputies, when we ſend them to the Synods. The Form is conceived in theſe terms, which are reported by the Biſhop of <hi>Condom. We promiſe in the preſence of God, to ſubmit our ſelves to all, that ſhall be concluded and reſolved in your holy Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, to obey and execute it to the beſt of our power, being perſwaded that God will reſide there, and will direct you by his Holy Spirit in all truth and juſtice, by the Rule of his Word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Every one at the firſt light percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, that, as this Form is conceived, it is ſo far from ſuppoſing that the Synod cannot err, or from attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting an abſolute authority unto it, and independent upon Scripture, that it doth preciſely ſuppoſe the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. It cannot be ſufficiently won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at, how the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> could have ſo much miſtaken him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf herein, as he hath done; for he thinks that there is ſomething more in it, than in thoſe two other places,
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:37449:212"/>
of our diſcipline, and of the Synod of <hi>Charenton,</hi> which he had report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to ſhew that we yield a blind ſubmiſſion unto our Synods. His rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe there is ſubmiſſion given unto what ſhall be reſolved in the Synod, before it be known that it hath ſpoken according to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. The Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> takes for an abſolute power, that which is onely a condition, and a limitation to the power of the Synod. Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on requires amongſt us, that we ſhould preſume God preſides in theſe Aſſemblies, and the rules of juſtice and decency, yea even cuſtom, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit not that we ſhould explain our ſelves otherwiſe. But upon the whole, every one ſees that the ſenſe of this Form is, as if one ſhould ſay, we promiſe to ſubmit our ſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to what you ſhall reſolve, if, as we hope of you through the grace of God, you take his Word and his truth, for the rule of your thoughts and conduct, and thereby make appear, that it is indeed his Spirit that preſides in your conſultations, and
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:37449:212"/>
governs you, and that you do not proceed by canvaſing and Cabals, or by humane motives and intereſts, as the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Authours teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie it was done in the latter Councils of <hi>Conſtance</hi> and of <hi>Trent.</hi>

                  <hi>If it be,</hi> ſaith the Biſhop of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, a perſwaſion founded upon an humane preſumption, can any man in conſcience promiſe to ſubmit, himſelf to what ſhall be reſolved?

God, for the Rule of their conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>Upon which it is to be obſerved, though it may be too long to inſiſt upon what is ſo clear in it ſelf, that our Synods in the whole are made up onely of divers Deputies, which have all of them their Letters in the ſame Form, almoſt after the ſame manner as have they which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted unto the Provincial Eſtates: ſo that things being equal amongſt them, it cannot be ſaid that this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and this limitation, can wound the dignity or juſt authority of theſe Aſſemblies.</p>
               <p>Theſe Letters miſſive, are proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nothing elſe but proxies, or if the term pleaſe better, in ſome meaſure reſemble Letters and Commiſſions which Princes give to their Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, or their Envoys, the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, ſtyle whereof is, that they have intire truſt and confidence in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, fidelity and ability of them whom they ſend, giving them full power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nevertheleſs with this condition underſtood all along, that
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:37449:214"/>
they govern themſelves by their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and inſtructions, and that if they conform themſelves thereunto, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they ſhall conclude ſhall be confirmed. The difference betwixt theſe ſorts of Letters of deputation, and proxies in matters of buſineſs, and the Commiſſions of Princes, is onely in the quality and ſtyle of them who ſpeak; Princes ſpeak as Princes men of buſineſs like men of buſineſs, and Churches in a ſtyle pious, and Chriſtian: ſo that theſe Letters miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive not onely give merely a limitted and conditional power, but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions themſelves which are made by virtue of this power, though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the Scripture, according to the condition expreſſed in the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, paſs not for authentical decrees, till they are brought unto the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and the Churches have as it were ratified them by their acquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence: and when it falls out that any Church, or any particular perſons find any difficulties therein, the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is remitted to further conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the following Synods; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:37449:215"/>
it is a conſtant principle of Chriſtianity, according to us, that Faith is a firm perſwaſion, and by conſequence, that mens minds muſt be cleared and rendred capable, as far as may be, of the truths which are taught, that is to ſay, made to taſte the Doctrine with a certain ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and not have the belief im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by conſtraint, and abſolute dominion.</p>
               <p>What we have now ſaid of theſe Letters miſſive, ſerves for anſwer to the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi>'s laſt objection touching the reſolution taken up at the Synod of St. <hi>Faith;</hi> for there is throughout the ſame foundation, or rather the ſame pretence. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> ſtrains himſelf more on this matter, than on the others, and again inſults over us here, as if we were of bad Faith, and of little accord amongſt our ſelves. Let us ſee what the matter is.</p>
               <p>In the year 1578. there was an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verture of reconciliation made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt thoſe that are called <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and our Churches of <hi>France,</hi> by
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:37449:215"/>
means of a Form of confeſſion of Faith, which was to be general and common unto all the Churches. The Churches of this Kingdom were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to depute good men, authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Church, <hi>with power to treat, accord, and decide all the points of Doctrine, and other things which might concern that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion.</hi> Upon this propoſition the Synod de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, that <hi>if the confeſſion of Faith propoſed, were ſent time enough, it ſhould be examined in each Provincial Synod;</hi> and in the mean time, the Synod deputed four Miniſters with Letters, <hi>and ample proxies of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and Elders, and of Mounſieur the Vicount of</hi> Turenn: and in caſe they ſhould not have time enough to examine this confeſſion of Faith in all the Provinces, they remitted it unto the prudence of thoſe Deputies, <hi>to accord and conclude of all points, which ſhould come under deliberation, whether of Doctrine, or any thing elſe that might concern the good, the union, and the eaſe of all the Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is in ſumme the reſolution of
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:37449:216"/>
this Synod, as the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> reports it; and it is plain here, that there is nothing that is not agreeable to reaſon and cuſtome. In the mean while he proceeds, with a kind of admiration. <hi>To this head doth the falſe ſqueamiſhneſs of the Gentlemen of the pretended reformed Religion come: they have now thus and thus often upbraided to us, as a weakneſs, that ſubmiſſion which we have for the decrees of the Church, which is nothing elſe, ſay they, but a ſociety of men, ſubject to errour: and mean time, they have not feared to commit their Faith into the hands of four men, with ſo large aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning their own judgment, that they have given them full power to change the very confeſſion of Faith, which they propoſe at this day to all the Chriſtian World, and that as a confeſſion of Faith, which contains nothing but the pure Word of God, and for which they have ſaid, at their preſenting it to our Kings, that an infinite number of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were ready to ſhed their bloud.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this head in fine, is the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi>'s evil reflexion come:
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:37449:216"/>
                  <hi>they have,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>thus and thus oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en upbraided to us as a weakneſs, the ſubmiſſion which we have for the decrees of the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the firſt place it had been juſt, that the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> would have been pleaſed to have told us, at leaſt ſomewhere, what we are to underſtand by the <hi>Church.</hi> It is a great name indeed, and for which we have a true and ſincere reſpect: but is not this to abuſe names, and to neglect the things, as thoſe who cryed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the Temple, the Temple. If they will have us to render ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, let them tell us at leaſt to whom we ſhould render it. The Queſtion is to know, in whom this infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and this abſolute and ſupreme Authority reſides, of whom we ſhould receive theſe final judgments <hi>without examining them.</hi> Is it the Pope or the Council that is infallible, and unto whom we muſt thus blindly ſubmit? The Pope either above the Council to approve of it, and to give it all its authority; or onely in the moſt eminent place of the Council for
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:37449:217"/>
order amongſt the Councils them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? Is it all the Councils toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that are infallible, and whoſe deciſions we muſt follow, or onely thoſe Councils, which have deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined according to the allowance of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church? Thoſe of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> and of <hi>Francfort,</hi> which prohibit the worſhipping of Images, or the ſecond Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> which in expreſs terms enjoins the adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them; or in fine that of <hi>Trent,</hi> which onely ſaith to ſerve and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and give unto them the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that is due? And as to this Council of <hi>Trent</hi> it ſelf, ought we to take all together as they do in <hi>Spain,</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> or reject all which is contrary to the juſt Liberties of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, as is done in France? And in fine, how can we be aſſured, that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God preſided in ſome of their Seſſions, and not in all, that they have erred in one point, and that they are infallible in another.</p>
               <p>Theſe are not queſtions made at pleaſure, or School queſtions, as
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:37449:217"/>
the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> would inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, to palliate the profound ſilence that he keeps upon all theſe things: neither are they like many other que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, really uſeleſs, whereof ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs the Council hath made ſo many Articles of Faith. Theſe are important matters, which ought not onely to be known for curioſities ſake, but which are to be practiſed, and by conſequence well underſtood to regulate our conſcience. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> propoſing to himſelf to make a compleat Expoſition of his Belief, one would think it had been more agreeable to his deſign, to let us have underſtood it a little plainer, and more openly, than to have conceald all the difficulties through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and onely endeavoured to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate doubts upon ſome points of ours: for the poſitive, clear, and ſincere propoſal of a Doctrine, doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade it much better, than do Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes.</p>
               <p>Let us return notwithſtanding to what the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> imputes to us; <hi>they</hi> (ſaith he ſpeaking of us)
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:37449:218"/>
                  <hi>upbraid to us our ſubmiſſion to the Church.</hi> Yes, a blind ſubmiſſion, without examining any thing, as the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> propoſes; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a ſlavery directly contrary to the Spirit of Chriſtianity; a ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in fine, of body rather than of mind, which tends to the plunging men into that groſs ignorance from whence Chriſtianity had delivered them: for as to a free and voluntary ſubmiſſion, and with knowledge, ſuch as the Scripture requires, being very far from blaming it, we teach it, we preach it, and God be prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, we practiſe it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But you your ſelves alſo,</hi> ſaith the Biſhop of <hi>Condom, have this weakneſs, and blind ſubmiſſion, which you up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid to us.</hi> When perſons are char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with Opinions, which do open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contradict one another, if the proof be not clear, it deſtroys it ſelf: Now what is the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi>'s proof? <hi>You have,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>put your Faith into the hands of four Miniſters, ſo far leaving it to them, that you have given them full power to alter your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:37449:218"/>
of Faith.</hi> Theſe are the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi>'s words, and not ours; this is a commentary upon the decree of the Synod, or a conſequence which the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> draws thence, aggravating the terms, and not at all the ſenſe, nor expreſſions of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree it ſelf. The decree gives power to agree and conclude upon all points, which ſhall come under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and not to change the confeſſion of Faith. Theſe are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent terms: and though it might be preſumed, that ſuch reconciliations are never made, without uſing ſome temper, which may content mens minds on the one part and the other, and that this overture of reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was founded upon the project of ſome confeſſion of Faith, which was to be common, yet to reſtrain ſome opinion which was not eſſentially ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, or even to change or ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en ſome expreſſion, would not be to change a confeſſion of Faith.</p>
               <p>In all likelihood, the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> will not diſapprove of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, for therein lyes all the ſubtilty
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:37449:219"/>
of his Expoſition, to ſweeten what he can, and to let alone what he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſweeten. The difficulty is onely in keeping a mans ſelf within juſt bounds, not too much to weaken the ſenſe in ſweetning, and not to looſe too much by ſilence; that is to ſay, that men abandon not Worſhips or Doctrines which do viſibly tend to the glory of God, nor change the nature of a Doctrine by reducing it unto ſweeter terms. It belongs to the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> himſelf, and to thoſe who ſhall read his Treatiſe, to judge whether he hath kept himſelf within theſe juſt bounds; as it would have belonged unto our Churches to have judged whether their Deputies had kept themſelves, if it had happened that they had entred into conference with the <hi>Lutherans.</hi> To conclude, as it is princ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It would ſeem, that if the <hi>Lutherans</hi> could not intirely have accorded to our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, they would have reduced theirs unto what the ableſt amongſt them do, which is, not to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the manner how Jeſus Chriſt is really preſent in the Sacrament. <hi>VVe believe,</hi> ſay they, <hi>his preſence, and we feel therein his efficacy, but we are ignorant here of the manner.</hi> And in this caſe it may plainly be ſeen, that they approached nearer unto us, than we did to them, in admitting them hereby to our communion, without having made for all that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on our part, any eſſential alteration in our confeſſion of Faith.</p>
               <p>But ſome will ſay, how comes it to paſs that you ſpeak here ſo mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately of the <hi>Lutherans?</hi> Your firſt Reformers were not at all ſo reſerved: it is very well known, how far the ſharp words, which they wrote one againſt another, did proceed. They, whoſe inſtitution you follow, found that our Doctrine of Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was more conſequent, than the
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:37449:220"/>
real preſence of the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and teſtified in ſome ſort a greater averſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for that of the <hi>Lutherans</hi> than for ours. Whence comes it then to paſs that you have admitted them into your communion? The conſequence would conclude, and why will you not admit us alſo? But the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth not ſo take it; ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, why do you not come unto us, though the ſequel of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth not admit of it. However the caſe ſtands, piety and charity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that Chriſtians ſhould be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate: if it appears, that we are more moderate herein than our firſt Reformers, it is not, that we do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to have more piety, nor more charity than they, but it is, that commonly diviſions are fiercer in their firſt beginning, than in proceſs of time; and greater betwixt perſons that are nearer, than betwixt thoſe who are at the greateſt diſtance. This very thing that they of our commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ſeemed to have more heat againſt the <hi>Lutherans</hi> upon the particular point of the Reality, is a ſign that
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:37449:220"/>
they were the better united one with the other in all the other points. We pretend not wholly to excuſe this heat, nor the other failings unto which the firſt Reformers might be ſubject: We have a cuſtomary ſaying amongſt us, that we canonize not any. Wherefore, without equalling them unto the Apoſtles, unleſs it be for what there was humane in the one and the other, might it not be ſaid of our Reformers, what the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles themſelves ſaid of themſelves, that they were men ſubject to like paſſions with us. All the World knows what is uſually ſaid upon this ſubject, that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> thoſe bleſſed Apoſtles, were ſo ſharp in words to each other, that they came even to a provocation and a quarrel (for the Scripture term amounts to ſo much) and that it muſt needs be that they parted aſunder. And if the Example of Saints, which the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church have canonized themſelves, affect them more, it is known how <hi>Stephen</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> did excommunicate
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:37449:221"/>
St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Carthage;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Firmil. Ep. ad Cypria. Hieron. Ep. ad Theoph. Alex. Cum. oper. Theoph.</note> how St. <hi>Jerome</hi> was incenſed againſt St. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> and many other Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of diſcord amongſt great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p>But not to inſtance ſo far back in the Ages paſt, we have ſeen in our dayes how far contention hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded betwixt perſons eſteemed the moſt pious and eminent of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church upon points of Doctrine. The circumſtances of the times where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our Reformers lived, and their temper, if any pleaſe, may poſſibly in ſome meaſure excuſe the too much heat, wherewith it may be thought they defended themſelves, whether againſt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or againſt their own Brethren; if it be ſuppoſed in the main, that their intentions were upright and ſincere: as alſo the like temper, and other circumſtances, may excuſe the heat which hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared betwixt theſe two parties, if it be granted, upon the main, that this heat was a right zeal.</p>
               <p>After all, it is but upon the ſole point of the Tranſubſtantiation of the
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:37449:221"/>
Gentlemen of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, &amp; the Conſubſtantiation of the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans,</hi> that ſome of ours may have ſaid, that the Doctrine of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is more conſiſtent, that is to ſay, that if the Reality of the preſence muſt be believed, it would ſeem here is more reaſon, according to the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations of the School, to believe that this preſence is effected by the way of change of one ſubſtance into another, than by the way of impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or by the co-exiſtence of two ſubſtances of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, and of the Sacraments one with the other: and that ſuppoſing, that the Body of Jeſus Chriſt was really pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, there would be more reaſon to adore him in the Sacrament it ſelf, than not to adore him there at all. But upon the whole, theſe indeed are onely ſpeculations of the Schools, and private Opinions: and as theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> taking them aright, are onely conſequences which no wayes engage thoſe, who onely admit the <hi>Lutherans</hi> into their communion; ſo it plainly appears,
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:37449:222"/>
that when the heat of diſpute leaves the mind in an entire liberty in this regard, we have been able to admit them into our communion, without its being any reaſon that we ſhould paſs unto that of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> which joins unto Tranſubſtantiation, the Sacrifice of the Maſs, private Maſſes, the adoration of the Hoſt, and the taking away of the Cup, as inſeparable conſequences of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: not to ſpeak again here of the Service in an unknown Tongue, and the other worſhips and practices which ſeparate us from her.</p>
               <p>However the caſe ſtands in this regard, this being the ſtate of things betwixt us and the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> it is evident that our Churches entring into conference with them, expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not themſelves unto any eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial alteration in our confeſſion of Faith; ſo far were they from putting it into the hands of Compromiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, whether we regard the thing it ſelf, or the form of the power which they gave unto their Deputies: for as to the thing, when any difference
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:37449:222"/>
is treated of, the power which is given, how ample ſoever it be, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards onely the difference it ſelf, and extends not it ſelf unto other things, which are not in diſpute. For Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, when Princes give power to their Miniſters to make Treaties of peace, and of alliance, we do not ſay, that they put in compromiſs the fundamental Laws of their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms. There was ſo little to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on our ſide in our reconciliation with the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> that it was ſeen we made no difficulty to admit them into our communion, aſſoon as ſome amongſt them deſired it of us. And as to what concerned the power it ſelf, that could not expoſe us any thing the more; for beſides what hath been ſaid of the ſtate of our difference with the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> the Synod knew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand the plain ſtate and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon which the reconciliation was to be made, that is to ſay, in a manner the very ſenſe and form in which it was judged, that a confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Faith might be made, that might be common with us, and the
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:37449:223"/>
                  <hi>Lutherans.</hi> It is well known, that on ſuch occaſions, the power is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative, and as it were reſtrained, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the memoires and inſtructions which are given to the Deputies. If it falls out that they abuſe it, they who gave it, are acquitted upon their diſapproving what they have done: the ſhame of the diſapprovement falls properly upon them; there is no blame at the moſt, but onely of the bad choice that was made of their miniſtry. In a word, what removes all difficulty in this regard, is, that theſe ſorts of accords, howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Deputies conclude, muſt be approved and ratified by thoſe who granted the power, before it can be ſaid that they have truly conſented.</p>
               <p>If the project of this reconciliation had further ſucceeded, and that a Form of confeſſion had been agreed upon, it had been neceſſary accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the practice of our Diſcipline, that all that had been accorded by the Deputies at the conference, ſhould have been ſent and communicated to our Provincial Synods, to the end,
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:37449:223"/>
that the Deputies of Provincial Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods, might afterwards have met in a National Synod: there all would have been maturely conſidered, with a full liberty of advice; and ſuppoſe that it had been found, that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties had yielded unto ſomething at the conference againſt the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Churches, it would not onely have been diſapproved, but bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and cenſured. If on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary it had been found, that they had done their duty, as it ought to be preſumed they would, that the Form of confeſſion, whereupon they had agreed, had contained all the eſſential fundamental Articles of what is believed amongſt us, and that there had been no Article in this Form of confeſſion, which had deſtroyed our fundamental Articles, in this caſe we ſhould have praiſed God for ſo full and happy a re-union; The Synod would have approved and ratified it: they would have framed an Act, that ſhould have contained the motives, the grounds, and principal reaſons of their decree, and the Deputies of
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:37449:224"/>
Provinces would have been enjoined to obtain alſo the final acquieſcence of the Churches by their ſilence.</p>
               <p>Let it now be judged, whether there be any thing in all this, that in the leaſt tends to eſtabliſh that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, and abſolute dominion, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> attributes either to Popes or Councils, which is the onely thing here in queſtion, whether there be the leaſt pretext to accuſe us, as the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> doth of a <hi>feigned niceneſs, and of an abandoning of our Belief;</hi> or whether this be not a trick of expreſſion, not ſo equitable as ſhould be, to caſt a foul inſinuation on a great bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, without any ground.</p>

In the firſt Impreſſion of his Treatiſe, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſaid, as in paſſage, <hi>that God

                  <hi>to preſerve unity,</hi> he adds, <hi>This is the reaſon that our confeſſion of Faith obliges us to acknowledge the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>as the Mother and Miſtreſs</hi> [Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtram] <hi>of all other Churches, and to render a perfect obedience to the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign High Prieſt, Succeſſour of St.</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>and Vicar of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> And it is true, that the profeſſion of Faith made by <hi>Pius</hi> the IV. in execution of the Decree of the Council, doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the ſame thing in ſo many words.</p>
               <p>But in the ſecond Edition, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> recalls what there was ſtronglieſt ſpoke in the former, to wit, theſe terms of <hi>Miſtreſs, Soveraign, Vicar of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> which is due unto him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be that he would not engage to maintain theſe expreſſions in the extent of them, or whether he was loath to anger us; or in fine, for ſome other reaſon that he had.

of that of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> which we have ſaid that he ſuppoſed) <hi>in the Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours of the Prince of the Apoſtles, unto whom is due, for this reaſon, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and obedience, which the Holy Councils and Fathers have alwayes taught.</hi> So that in ſtead of explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to us the Doctrine of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, as he promiſed he would do by his Expoſition, for all the inſtruction and all the light he'l give us, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits us to the Fathers and Councils, and keeps himſelf yet in terms more general, more obſcure, and more doubtful, than the profeſſion of Faith of the very Council it ſelf.</p>
               <p>It is true, the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> here again covers his ſilence with this pretext, that <hi>as to things which are diſputed of in the Schools, though the Miniſters inceſsantly alledge them to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this power of the Pope odious, it is not neceſsary to ſpeak of them, becauſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>they are not of the Catholick Faitb.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in all likelihood, by <hi>theſe things which are diſputed,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> here onely means the abuſe of
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:37449:225"/>
diſpenſations, and of Indulgences, the power of depoſing Kings, and to abſolve Subjects from the Oath of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance, and ſuch other matters, as are truly odious: but for thoſe things which preciſely regard the ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that the Popes pretend due, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in matters of Faith, or of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment Eccleſiaſtical, though they are diſputed as well out of the Schools, as in the Schools, if the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> avers that they are no more of the Catholick Faith, we demand no more herein; it may be ſaid, that the greateſt part of the authority of the Popes, contains nothing of great moment.</p>
               <p>As to what remains, it were eaſie to ſhew in this place, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Councils, unto whom the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> refers us, have not alwayes taught, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was to be acknowledged as the <hi>mother and miſtreſs of all others,</hi> nor the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> as <hi>Soveraign High Prieſt,</hi> ſole Head, and onely Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour of the Prince of the Apoſtles, and Vicar of Jeſus Chriſt, nor that in this
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:37449:226"/>
quality, the ſubmiſſion and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which he at this day claims of all the World, is due unto him. Thoſe who are but the leaſt verſt in Hiſtory, and judge without prejudice, do well know,<note place="margin">Diſt. <hi>22.</hi> ca. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae.</note> that 'tis onely the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> once the chief City of the World, and the Seat of the Empire, which hath given occaſion to the exalting the <hi>Holy Chair</hi> as they ſpeak, not onely above other Epiſcopal Chairs, but above Kings and Emperours themſelves.</p>
               <p>It might alſo be ſhewed very clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the Scripture, that the very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Primacy of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> upon which the Authority of the Pope is grounded, is not it ſelf founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any thing; for St. <hi>Peter</hi> had no more but his function of an Apoſtle like the reſt. It is ſaid in the Eighth of the Acts, that <hi>the Apoſtles which were in</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>ſent</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi> John <hi>to</hi> Samaria; a paſſage which doth not intimate,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.11.</note> that St. <hi>Peter</hi> did attribute to himſelf any dominion over his Fellow Labourers. The others are called <hi>pillars of the Church</hi> as well as
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:37449:226"/>
he: St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith himſelf, that he <hi>withſtood him to the face;</hi> and if it were true, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> had ſome prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy amongſt the Apoſtles, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his age, or of his zeal, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it appears he ſpake firſt on ſeveral occaſions, who ſees not that it can be at moſt but a primacy of order and rank in his own perſon, ſuch as there muſt needs be in all Aſſemblies, and which would make no more for the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> than for thoſe of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and in general for all the Biſhops and Paſtours of the Church? but this is alſo one of thoſe Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, upon which there are whole Volumes written; and the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> paſſing ſo lightly over this matter, as he does, this is not a place neither to ſearch deeplier in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.</p>
               <p>We have onely to add for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, that we are ſo far from <hi>abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing the Epiſcopal Government which was in force in the Apoſtles times,</hi> as the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> imputes to us, that our Churches maintaining as they do, an holy Union betwixt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:37449:227"/>
living in a great deal of ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity under the governance of our Paſtours and Synods, are a true Image of the ancient Churches of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> of <hi>Corinth,</hi> of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> of <hi>Galatia,</hi> of the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> of the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> and of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, all founded by the Apoſtles, affecting not at all any ſuperiority one over the other, but all being equal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves, united by the Bonds of the ſame Faith, and of the ſame charity, under the governance of the ſame Apoſtles, and under one ſole Spiritual Head, Jeſus Chriſt. The word <hi>Biſhop,</hi> as it is known, ſignifies onely an <hi>Overſeer,</hi> and no more than that of a Paſtour, or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter; the Apoſtles are indifferently termed one and the other. It is known that in <hi>Germany,</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the name of Biſhops is retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and a kind of Hierarchy which we do not diſapprove of, being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate as it is. And in fine, God is our witneſs, that we love peace and union, as the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> de-f<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſires; but a true union of hearts and
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:37449:227"/>
judgements with knowledge; and, as God himſelf hath commanded, that we ſhould love, <hi>Peace with Truth.</hi>
